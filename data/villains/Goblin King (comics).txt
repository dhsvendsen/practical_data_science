'''[[Phil Urich|Philip "Phil" Urich]]''' is the second character to use the Goblin King alias.

Marvel Comics.</ref> While the celebration of Hobgoblin Day is being held with a parade in Kingsley's honor, Missile Mate betrays the Hobgoblin and attempts to murder in Goblin King's name.

Hobgoblin bests Goblin King in combat and delivers him and the Goblin Nation members with him to the authorities.<ref>''AXIS: Hobgoblin'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Having escaped prison under undisclosed circumstances during the "[[Go Down Swinging (comics)|Go Down Swinging]]" storyline, Urich raids one of Osborn's old gentlemen's clubs to acquire the Goblin weaponry Osborn stored there, but Osborn- currently wielding the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]'s power- apparently kills Urich by tearing his heart out.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #797.
