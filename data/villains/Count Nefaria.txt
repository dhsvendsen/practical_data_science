'''Count Luchino Nefaria''' is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==

The character first appears in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #13 (February 1965), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=94}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
'''Luchino Nefaria''' is a wealthy Italian [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]] and traditionalist that also desires greater wealth and power, driving him to join the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] criminal organization.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=106}}</ref> The recently formed [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] superhero team, however, thwart many of his plans and force a direct conflict, so Nefaria lures the Avengers to his castle on the pretense of a charity event, and places the group in suspended animation, using images which threaten to take control of America. After he releases them, the Avengers become suspicious of him after hearing they are wanted and they cannot remember what happened at the castle. They go to the castle, however nearly all of them are paralyzed by Nefaria's gas. Meanwhile, the [[Teen Brigade]] were captured by Nefaria, and when they tried to contact the Avengers were thrown in a dungeon which would place them into suspended animation if they touched the walls. [[Captain America]] gets into the castle without touching the ground, other Avengers, or walls, and freed the Teen Brigade, who gave the antidote to the Avengers. Captain America was also paralyzed, and with his hands and feet attached to ropes he was suspended between floor and ceiling, where Nefaria mocked him, saying he would be a hero for capturing him. However, Iron Man then burst through the wall. Neferia was defeated and deported after an officer heard him confess to being in the Maggia.<ref>''Avengers'' #13 (February 1965)</ref> In retaliation, Nefaria then unsuccessfully attempts to destroy [[Iron Man]],<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #67 (July 1965)</ref> and then suffers yet another defeat when stopped by the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[X-Men]] team.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #22-23 (July–August 1966)</ref>

Nefaria reappears several years later and attempts to take control of the United States base [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]], but is stopped by the X-Men once again. Nefaria attempts to escape in a plane which is attacked by the X-Man [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|Thunderbird]]. The plane then explodes, killing Thunderbird and injuring Nefaria.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #94-95 (August–October 1975)</ref>

Now virtually destitute and discredited, Nefaria hires the supervillains [[Living Laser]], [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] to form the second [[Lethal Legion]]. The group rob several banks, and unwittingly finance an experiment Nefaria has created in a bid to become superhuman. Employing the former scientific adviser to [[Heinrich Zemo]], Nefaria devises a means of temporarily amplifying the abilities of the Lethal Legion, and then sends them into combat against the Avengers. The effect, however, is temporary and once defeated their combined abilities are drained by Nefaria who possesses them magnified a hundredfold. After a long and protracted battle, Nefaria is finally defeated.<ref>''Avengers'' #164-166 (November 1977-January 1978)</ref>

Nefaria is then kept in isolation and under observation by the Avengers, and it is discovered that the process to empower him makes Nefaria immortal but vulnerable as his body reconfigures itself. Whitney Frost, also known as [[Madame Masque]] and the daughter of Nefaria, attempts to find a cure for what is believed to be his deteriorating condition. She hires the [[Ani-Men]] to attack [[Avengers Mansion]] and free her father. While battling Iron Man, Nefaria's life-support system is severed and his weakened form is crushed by a stored Jupiter Landing Vehicle.<ref>''Iron Man'' #115-116 (October–November 1978)</ref>  Nefaria briefly reappears some time later as a corpse reanimated by the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]. Grim Reaper directs Nefaria to attack the Avengers, but loses control soon afterwards and Nefaria dies once again.<ref>''Avengers'' #353-354 (Early-Late September 1992)</ref>

Nefaria eventually reappears, but in an [[ion]]ic humanoid form, and constantly requires ionic energy to sustain his existence. He battles Iron Man<ref>''Iron Man'' Annual 99</ref> and later Captain America and [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] in the [[Savage Land]] as he attempts to find sources of energy.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 3 #29-31 (June 2000)</ref> Nefaria then plans to detonate an ionic bomb, which will transform millions of people into an ionic state which he can then control, perceiving it as the best way to guarantee that he receives the respect that he feels he deserves. Nefaria gains control of the ionic heroes [[Wonder Man]] and [[Erik Josten|Atlas]] who he intends to use to kill the Avengers, but he is stopped by the combined efforts of the Avengers, fellow superhero team the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and Madame Masque, Masque using a weapon she had developed to disrupt Nefaria's own ionic energy.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 2 #32-34 (September–November 2000) and ''Thunderbolts'' #42-43 (September–October 2000)</ref> He is next seen as an inmate of The Raft, a prison for supervillains, and escapes when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] stages a mass breakout.<ref>''New Avengers'' #1-2 (January–February 2005)</ref>

Following the "[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]" storyline, Madame Masque sought out her father to help the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] after [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] took back the [[Norn Stones]]. The New Avengers capture John King (Hood's cousin) and use him to track the Hood and Madame Masque. After a battle with Count Nefaria, they capture the villains and bring all four of them to Maria Hill to place them under arrest.<ref>''New Avengers Finale'' one-shot</ref>

Nefaria returns within the pages of ''[[Moon Knight]]'', having established himself as the new Kingpin of [[Los Angeles]].<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 4 #7</ref> He kills [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]] in battle,<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 4 #9</ref> and is later apprehended by the Avengers.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 4 #12</ref> Also in L.A., [[Daken]] attempts to [[assassination|kill]] him but fails.<ref>''Daken: Dark Wolverine'' #21</ref> Later, back in New York, he is summoned by [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] to destroy [[The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl]] in dreams, but is bested at finger-counting, and leaves.<ref>''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' #11</ref>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Count Nefaria appears as a member of the Army of Evil and took part in the attack on Manhattan in retaliation for what happened at Pleasant Hill during "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]".<ref>''Secret Empire'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Spider-Geddon]]" storyline, Count Nefaria is engaging Superior Octopus who counters his ionic abilities by having his tentacles charged with energy that disrupts ionic fields. Count Nefaria breaks free from the tentacles as Superior Octopus plans to threaten his mother Vitto Nefaria and his relatives Giuseppe Nefaria and Paolo Nefaria who he is spying on with his Octobots. Count Nefaria takes his leave and vows to return when Superior Octopus' role as San Francisco's protector destroys him.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a lead-up to the "Sins Rising" arc, a wheelchair-bound Count Nefaria later forms his latest incarnation of the Lethal Legion with Grey Gargoyle, Living Laser, and Whirlwind in a plot to target the Catalyst.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #41. Marvel Comics.</ref> At Empire State University, Dr. Curt Connors reveals the Catalyst to the crowd when the Lethal Legion attacks. While Grey Gargoyle and Whirlwind attack the people present, Living Laser helps Count Nefaria to operate the Catalyst. Spider-Man shows up and has a hard time fighting them due to the fact that his mind was focused on what a revived [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] did to [[Overdrive (character)|Overdrive]]. Sin-Eater shows up and starts using the same gun he used on Overdrive on Whirlwind and Grey Gargoyle while taking their powers. Immobilizing Spider-Man with Grey Gargoyle's powers, Sin-Eater proceeded to do the same thing to Living Laser and Count Nefaria. All four of them were sent to Ravencroft where they started to act like model inmates. Norah Winters was allowed by Norman Osborn to interview them about Sin-Eater. Count Nefaria expressed remorse over his actions.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #46. Marvel Comics.</ref> When a riot occurs at Ravencroft, Count Nefaria informs Norman Osborn that Sin-Eater is coming for him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #47. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As a side-effect of Sin-Eater's suicide upon copying [[Julia Carpenter|Madame Web]]'s precognition revealed that [[Harry Osborn#Kindred|Kindred]] was using them, Count Nefaria and the rest of the Lethal Legion regained their sins and are among the villains that went on a rampage.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #56. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Count Nefaria was a normal human with a genius intellect long before he'd gained his superpowers. He was a well versed scientist, inventor, theoretical physicist, adept strategist and organizational leader with deep ties to the underworld through his own crime family, [[Maggia (comics)|The Maggia]]. Such a taciturn criminal mastermind is he that upon his first appearance he'd easily turned the American public and the world over against The Avengers in their first meeting.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 1 #13 (Feb, 1965)</ref> It wasn't until being subjected to a process perfected by one of Baron Heinrich Zemo's scientists Dr. Kenneth Sturdy that he was granted the combined powers of the villains the [[Living Laser]] (energy projection), [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] (strength), and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] (speed), amplified a hundredfold.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 1 #164 (1977)</ref> Because of this, Nefaria is one of the physically strongest known humans in the Marvel Universe. He has toppled a 40-story building with little effort, withstood a blow from Wonder Man without flinching, and fought an enraged [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to a standstill with no apparent damage from strikes of his [[Mjolnir (comics)|hammer]], even stopping it with his bare hand.<ref>''Avengers'' #166 (1977)</ref>

The character then aged until his body evolved, eventually shifting into pure ionic form. This increasing his already insurmountable abilities while granting him new ones,<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol 1 #43 (2000)</ref> such as the creation and manipulation of ionic energy for teleportation,<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol 6 #6 (Dec, 2011)</ref><ref>''Avengers Confidential: Black Widow & Punisher'' (Mar, 25 2014)</ref> hand and eye blasts,<ref>''New Avengers'' Finale #1 (May, 2010)</ref> ionic force punches,<ref>''Marvel Action: Avengers'' Vol 1 The Ruby Egress #1 (Oct, 23 2019)</ref> and/or controlling other ionic beings (and potentially gamma mutates) via parasitically siphoning their energies.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol 1 116 (Nov, 1978)</ref><ref>''Marvel Avengers: The Ultimate Character Guide'' Vol 1 #1 (Sep, 2010)</ref> Through this he can also convert others into ionic energy beings as well, in a vampiric fashion, turning them into his superpowered thralls.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 3 #32</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol 1 #43 (2000)</ref> As such, Nefaria is effectively immortal and virtually indestructible. He also has the power of flight, when before he could only leap great distances.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 1 #165 (1977)</ref> He's also showcased a new power, creating energy constructs to surround his opponents in ionic energy and move them about telekinetically.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol 1 #2 (Nov, 2007)</ref><ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol 6 #1 (May, 2011)</ref> He has withstood simultaneous attacks by multiple teams of superheros at once.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 3 #33 (2000)</ref> Although it is possible to deplete Nefaria's ionic energy in combat by forcing him to expend it faster than his body can replenish it, [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]] calculated that it would take three weeks of constant combat – without even giving Nefaria time to pause for breath – for even the combined forces of the Avengers and the Thunderbolts to deplete his ionic energy reserves completely in that manner. However, Madame Masque has developed a weapon that disrupts Nefaria's ionic energy.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 2 #34 (Nov, 2000)</ref>

As a head of the Maggia, Count Nefaria also has access to vast amounts of technology, munitions, and gadgetry developed by his Research and Development department.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' Vol 1 #67 (Jul, 1965)</ref> Much of this, he had a hand in crafting, such as the Electro-disc, Time Transcender Ray, Visio-Projector, Worldwide Electro-scanner, The Dream Master and the Ionic Bomb.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 1 #13</ref><ref>''Tales of Suspense'' Vol 1 #67</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol 1 #43 (2000)</ref> Being of Italian nobility, Count Nefaria has also inherited a vast fortune, which he has used in conjunction with his intellect for the purpose of furthering his revenue and power. To that end he would use it for the hiring of super villains, scientists and expendable workforce in his organization branch for the creation of inventions that were far in the advances of modern science, give himself super powers or broaden the reach of his connections to both the unlawful and political circuit of the world. Being an aristocrat of understandable stature and influence, Nefaria also has claims to diplomatic immunity and as such he cannot be tried outside of his own home country.<ref>''Marvel Avengers: The Ultimate Character Guide'' #1</ref>
