The '''Rhino''' ('''Aleksei Sytsevich'''; [[English language|English]]: Ah-lek-see set-seh-vich; [[Russian language|Russian]]: Алексей Сицевич) is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]], and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #41 (Oct. 1966).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=296}}</ref> The character is a Russian thug who gained an artificial skin covering that grants him superhuman strength, through an experimental procedure. Rebelling against the scientists responsible for his transformation, the Rhino used his new powers to become a successful criminal, and soon clashed with superheroes [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Hulk]]. The character is typically portrayed as a dimwitted brute, who unleashes chaos wherever he goes, but can be easily deceived and, thus, defeated.

One of Spider-Man's most prominent adversaries, the Rhino has been adapted into various forms of media since his debut during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], including [[animated television series]] and [[video game]]s. He has also been featured in Marvel merchandise such as [[action figure]]s and [[trading card]]s. [[Paul Giamatti]] played a version of Aleksei Systevich who uses rhinoceros-themed battle armor, similarly to the character's [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation, in the 2014 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''.

==Publication history==
Described by writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] as "famously one of Spider-Man's dimmest villains",<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref> the character debuted in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #41–43 (Oct.–Dec. 1966) as a thug for hire working for an [[Eastern Bloc]] country.<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 36|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Now it was time for [John Romita, Sr.] to introduce a new Spidey villain with the help of [Stan] Lee.

The Rhino returned in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (vol. 2) #104 (June 1968), and although he apparently died at the end of the story, the character was revived in ''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #124 (Feb. 1970), becoming a perennial opponent for both Spider-Man and the Hulk.

The character achieved significant exposure in the 1980s and 1990s, appearing in both a solo capacity and as a villain for hire in over 12 titles. Significant appearances included starring in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1–4 (May–Aug. 1991); the "[[Flowers for Rhino]]" storyline in ''[[Spider-Man's Tangled Web]]'' #5–6 (Oct.–Nov. 2001), which is told from the character's perspective; and ''Punisher War Journal'' (vol. 2) #13–15 (Jan.–March 2008), in which the Rhino begins to rethink his lifestyle.

==Fictional character biography==
Aleksei Sytsevich was a thug who worked for [[Eastern Bloc]] scientists. The scientists subjected him to a process that gave him an artificial skin covering which granted him superhuman strength.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #43</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=119}}</ref> After being empowered, Aleksei Sytsevich rebels against the agents who gave him these powers and destroys their laboratory.  He is subsequently hired to kidnap [[Colonel]] [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] in order to obtain extraterrestrial spores that Jameson has been exposed to during a space mission. Jameson is rescued and the Rhino defeated by the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. The Rhino is imprisoned and kept there under sedation, but soon breaks out and continues his kidnap attempt against Jameson. Spider-Man uses a web imbued with a chemical developed by [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]] to melt off his Rhino suit and knock him unconscious.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #41–43 (Oct. – Dec. 1966)</ref>

After serving his prison term, the Rhino is approached by the same scientists, who bombard him with gamma radiation (exposure to which granted the character the [[Hulk]] his super-powers) to increase the Rhino's strength. The scientists also equip him with a more durable, acid-proof suit that "complements" the gamma ray procedure, granting the Rhino even more strength while he wears it. The Rhino agrees to find and kidnap [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] (the Hulk's human [[alter-ego]]) for his knowledge of gamma radiation; the Rhino then trains to fight the Hulk. However, the Rhino finds himself hopelessly overpowered in the ensuing battle, as the Hulk shrugs off his strongest blows, pummels him to the brink of death, and leaves him in a [[coma]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #104 (June 1968)</ref>

The character is revived from his coma by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] months later. The Leader plans to interrupt Banner's wedding to [[Betty Ross]], using a ray to transform him into the Hulk and make him kill Ross; he revived the Rhino to protect him from the Hulk's inevitable desire for revenge. The Rhino, however, betrays the Leader by attacking Banner the moment he transforms. The Rhino is still unable to harm the seemingly invulnerable Hulk, and he turns on the Leader after the Leader accidentally shoots him. The Rhino is caught in the explosion of the Leader's escape module and again is left in a coma.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #124 (Feb. 1970)</ref>The Leader, who was [[paralyzed]] after a previous encounter with the Hulk, finds and takes mental control of the Rhino's still-comatose body and attacks the Hulk. The battle eventually leads to an alien world, where the Leader abandons control of the Rhino and flees. Bruce and an unconscious-but-now-recovered Rhino travel back to Earth on a [[rocket]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #157–159 (Nov. 1972 – Jan. 1973)</ref>

The Rhino reappears with the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], and the pair activate a [[gamma bomb]] at [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] Base in an attempt to destroy the Hulk. [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]] deactivates the bomb, and the Hulk tricks the villains during combat, forcing them to collide and knock each other unconscious.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #171 (Jan. 1974)</ref>The Rhino reappears as a member of the supervillain team the [[Emissaries of Evil]] II (consisting also of [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]], [[Solarr]] and the [[Cobalt Man]]), in search of a rare [[Gemstone|jewel]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=299}}</ref> Opposed by the superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], the Rhino and Solarr initially hold their own until defeated by [[Doctor Strange]], who has become possessed by the jewel and transformed into the [[Red Rajah]].<ref>''Defenders'' #42–43 (Dec. 1976 – Jan. 1977)</ref> While in hiding, the Rhino is found and outwitted by scientist [[Doc Samson]] and is eventually defeated.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #218 (Dec. 1977)</ref>

When the Rhino robs a bank and a security guard is accidentally killed, he is humiliated by the [[Punisher]] and saved by Spider-Man before being killed.

During ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline, the Rhino decides to give up his life of crime entirely. He surrenders to the police and pleads guilty to all charges against him. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] removes his Rhino suit, and he is sentenced to 25 years in Ryker's Island. The Russian Mafia and other criminal gangs try to recruit him, but he denies them, even going so far as to completely avoid a breakout at one point. For his good behavior and cooperation, he is released early on parole. Upon release, he is met by [[Doctor Tramma]], who wants to re-invent the Rhino. The Rhino, however, declines Doctor Tramma's offer and tries to begin a new life, dating (and eventually marrying) a waitress, Oksana, and residing in a small apartment in [[Yonkers]]. Doctor Tramma eventually uses someone else to create a new and improved Rhino. The Rhino feels a need to face and kill the new Rhino to get rid of him, but Spider-Man convinces him to promise otherwise and helps the Rhino keep his new life by defeating the new Rhino.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #617">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #617 (March 2010)</ref> The new Rhino attacks Sytsevich at one of [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s press meetings. Feeling he could not break his promise to Spider-Man, Sytsevich lies to the new Rhino, telling him he will agree to fight him in his suit, but he instead goes into hiding with his wife Oksana. Before they arrive at their safehouse, the new Rhino attacks again, and Oksana dies as a result. Sytsevich re-dons his old Rhino suit and attacks the new Rhino. With one hit, the Rhino completely destroys the new Rhino's suit. Spider-Man begs Sytsevich to stop, but the now-grief-stricken Rhino disregards him and kills the new Rhino.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #625">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #625 (March 2010)</ref>

The Rhino is invited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to join his supervillain team, where he becomes involved in securing specific items for him. He shows up after Spider-Man makes the [[Freak (Spider-Man villain)|Freak]] collide with the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. Spider-Man talks him down from a fight.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #644. Marvel Comics.</ref>The Rhino is later seen as a member of Doctor Octopus' [[Sinister Six]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Doctor Octopus self-destructs his own lair, the Rhino pins Silver Sable to the floor in a flooding corridor, telling Spider-Man he will remain there to take Silver Sable with him to death.

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event as part of the lead-up to the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, the Rhino resurfaces months later, having survived his apparent demise. He has remained in hiding in Tahuexco, [[Guatemala]]. A mysterious [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|red-suited man]] approaches the Rhino and persuades him to do the red-suited man's bidding.

==Powers and Abilities==
Mutagenic chemical and radiation treatments, including gamma ray bombardment, provides the Rhino with superhuman strength, heightened levels of speed and stamina and a high degree of durability. The Rhino's superhuman speed allows him to run and/or exercise at high velocities, especially over short distances. He frequently "charges" his opponents in this manner, enabling him to cause great harm to most enemies and the surrounding area. The Rhino is notorious, however, for his lack of agility and slow reaction time. This makes it nearly impossible for him to change direction when running at such high speeds and also occasionally causes him to miss his target and collide with the wrong object.

The Rhino's enhanced musculature is much more efficient than that of a normal human and generates considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity. At his peak, he can exert himself physically for up to 24 hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood starts to impair him.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The Rhino has some experience in hand-to-hand combat, though he is generally much more of a brawler. Even so, his extreme levels of strength, stamina and resistance to injury make him a formidable opponent, regardless of a foe's superior fighting skills.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The Rhino possesses a thick polymer mat suit that resembles the physique of a [[rhinoceros]] and covers his entire body except for his face. The suit is highly resistant to damage and extreme temperatures, and it is also equipped with two horns, designed to mimic the general shape and function of actual rhinoceros horns, capable of penetrating two-inch plate steel. His first suit, more crude in overall design, was originally bonded to his skin, and he was unable to remove it. This suit was eventually destroyed and a second, removable suit, more form-fitting in its design, was created by [[Justin Hammer]]. This suit was given to the Rhino after he underwent additional gamma ray treatments that further heightened his powers and those of the new suit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Without the suit, the Rhino still possesses great superhuman strength and is highly resistant to conventional physical injury, such as most high-caliber bullets, extreme temperatures and impact forces. While wearing the suit, his strength is slightly increased, while his durability is enhanced to a much more significant degree. The suit also allows him to withstand most high-caliber bullets, exposure to temperature extremes of cold and heat without the suit cracking or melting or his own bodily tissues suffering damage, falls from great heights, light anti-tank weaponry, explosive concussions and potent acids without sustaining injury.

* The Rhino made two appearances in season one of the 1967 ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Ed McNamara]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} In the episode "Horn of the Rhino", he steals military equipment in an attempt to make an explosive weapon, framing [[Spider-Man]] for the theft in the process. The hero later deduces that the Rhino is hiding in a zoo's rhinoceros enclosure and defeats him. In the episode "The Golden Rhino", the Rhino steals a shipment of gold to make a gold statue of himself, which he succeeds in doing before he is captured by Spider-Man. He also appears in a self-titled season three compilation episode.

* The Rhino was a recurring villain in 1994's ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Don Stark]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} While his origin is not detailed in the series, this version still retains his comics counterpart's abilities, though he is portrayed as unintelligent. Debuting in the episode "The Alien Costume" Pt. 1, the Rhino is hired by the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] to steal a mineral from [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]'s space shuttle after it crash-landed on Earth. The Kingpin later sends the Rhino to obtain another item, during which he fights and is defeated by the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|black-suited]] Spider-Man. In "The Alien Costume" Pt. 3, Spider-Man, having gotten rid of the black suit, encounters the Rhino and fights him again. The latter defeats the former with the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]]'s help, but both are incapacitated by [[Eddie Brock|Venom]]. In the episodes "The Insidious Six" and "Battle of the Insidious Six", the Rhino appears as a member of the [[Sinister Six|titular team]] after the Kingpin breaks him and five other supervillains out of prison to kill Spider-Man, though he eventually defeats the group. In the five-part episode "Six Forgotten Warriors", the Rhino joins a reassembled Insidious Six to help the Kingpin steal the [[Red Skull]]'s [[doomsday device]]. After being defeated, the Rhino and most of the Insidious Six flee.

* The Rhino appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Clancy Brown]].<ref name="btva">{{cite web|title=Rhino Voice – Spider-Man franchise <nowiki>|</nowiki> Behind The Voice Actors|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Spider-Man/Rhino/|access-date=November 12, 2020|work=Behind The Voice Actors|postscript=. Check mark indicates role has been confirmed using screenshots of closing credits and other reliable sources.}}</ref> Originally a common thug under [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], Alex O'Hirn was partnered with [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Flint Marko]] and had repeated run-ins with Spider-Man. In "[[The Invisible Hand (The Spectacular Spider-Man)|The Invisible Hand]]", Tombstone has O'Hirn used as a guinea pig in [[Norman Osborn]]'s illegal experiments to prevent Spider-Man from interfering in his business. As a result, O'Hirn was infused with Dr. Otto Octavius's titanium resin armor and christens himself the Rhino. Although he proves to be a physically powerful foe, the armor obstructs his [[Sebaceous gland|pore]]s, forcing the Rhino to periodically stop and re-hydrate, which Spider-Man utilizes to defeat him. In "Group Therapy", the Rhino is broken out of prison alongside five other supervillains and forms the Sinister Six with them to seek revenge against Spider-Man, but the web-slinger is able to defeat the group using his black suit. In "Reinforcement", the Rhino reappears as part of a reassembled Sinister Six. Though he is defeated by Spider-Man once again, the Rhino escapes before the police can arrest him. In "Accomplices", the Rhino attempts to destroy specs that could create mass-produced Rhino soldiers. He briefly teams up with Spider-Man to successfully do so before betraying him, though he is defeated and arrested. In "Opening Night", having been imprisoned in the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], the Rhino and his fellow inmates are all released by the Green Goblin to hunt down Spider-Man while he was there to test the prison's maximum security cells. However, they are eventually subdued by gas released by [[Walter Hardy]] and re-incarcerated.

* The Rhino appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series, initially voiced by [[Max Mittelman]] and later by [[Daryl Sabara]].<ref name="btva"/> While this version is based on Alex O'Hirn, he differs from his [[Ultimate Marvel]] counterpart in that he is a highly intelligent teenager who transforms into a less intelligent anthropomorphic rhinoceros instead of wearing battle armor. Introduced in his self-titled episode, Alex attempts to seek revenge against his bully [[Flash Thompson]] by drinking a rhinoceros DNA serum that he stole from [[Oscorp]]. He is eventually defeated by Spider-Man and [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], and arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] In "The Sinister Six", the Rhino appears as a member of the titular team, agreeing to help [[Doctor Octopus]] kill Spider-Man in exchange for more Rhino formula. In "Return of the Sinister Six", Doctor Octopus provides the Rhino with tank-like armor so he can serve as a member of the Sinister Six once again until they are defeated by Spider-Man and his fellow [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D. trainees]]. In "Rampaging Rhino", having lost the ability to revert to his human form, the Rhino escapes S.H.I.E.L.D. custody to renew his vendetta against Thompson, who had since become Agent Venom, though the Rhino ultimately surrenders and allows himself to be recaptured. Following this, Spider-Man persuades him to join the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy and learn to use his powers for good. The Rhino makes minor appearances in subsequent episodes until "Lizards", when he betrays Spider-Man and helps Doctor Octopus kidnap Agent Venom, leading the others to believe the Rhino is a spy. In "Double Agent Venom", it is revealed that the Rhino agreed to work for Doctor Octopus again in exchange for regaining his human form, but he eventually sides with Spider-Man's team again and helps them rescue Agent Venom before Doctor Octopus places the Rhino under mind control. In "The New Sinister 6" Pt. 1, the brainwashed Rhino appears as a member of a [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]-backed Sinister Six and takes part in the team's attack on the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]. Before being defeated, he is able to briefly free himself from the mind control and warn Spider-Man that someone else on his team is the real spy. In the two-part series finale "Graduation Day", the mind-controlled Rhino was forced to join the Superior Sinister Six until Spider-Man reverts him to his human form, which frees him from Doctor Octopus's control. After the Superior Sinister Six are defeated, Alex rejoins S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.

* The Rhino appears in the 2010s ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Matthew Mercer]] (primarily) and [[Ben Pronsky]] (in "Dead Man's Party").<ref name="btva"/><ref>https://twitter.com/KevinShinick/status/904006052328333312</ref> This version of Aleksei Sytsevich is a student at Horizon High from Russia while his Rhino form has actual rhinoceroses' weaknesses, such as poor eyesight. Debuting in the episode "A Day in the Life", Aleksei is secretly injected with Rhino serum by [[Raymond Warren (comics)|Raymond Warren]]. In "Party Animals", the serum turns Aleksei into the Rhino, who rampages through Horizon High until Spider-Man subdues him and eventually restores him to his human form. In "The Rise of Doc Ock" Pts. 3 and 4, Aleksei is turned into the Rhino again by the Jackal, who gives him the additional ability to turn other people into Rhino-like monsters. He rampages through Osborn Academy until Spider-Man subdues him once more. Later, Doctor Octopus places the Rhino under mind control to make him join the Sinister Five until the two-part episode "The Hobgoblin", during which Spider-Man and [[Harry Osborn]] as the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|eponymous alias]] free him. The Rhino later goes on a rampage through the city until Spider-Man and the Hobgoblin defeat and capture him. In "Spider-Man Unmasked", [[Jefferson Davis (comics)|Swarm]] injects Aleksei and two others with the Rhino formula and turns them all into Rhinos until they are subdued and later cured off-screen by the Spider Team.
