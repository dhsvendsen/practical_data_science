'''Knull''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]. The character is depicted as an evil [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|deity]], who created the weapon known as All-Black the Necrosword and the alien races known as the [[Klyntar]] and Exolons. The character would go on to play a more important role in the [[Marvel Universe]].

== Publication history ==
The character was first introduced in ''Venom'' #3 (Aug 2018), giving a nod to a nameless being appearing in ''Thor: God of Thunder'' #6.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=205}}</ref> The character would be mentioned in various issues of ''[[Venom (comic book)|Web of Venom]]'', ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and "[[War of the Realms]]". After that, Knull was the main antagonist in [[Donny Cates]]’ ''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|Silver Surfer]]: Black'' #1.

Knull returned in ''[[King in Black]]'' as the main antagonist, which centers on his attack on Earth with his symbiote army.

== Fictional character biography ==
Knull is a primordial deity that came into being following the destruction of the sixth iteration of the cosmos,<ref>''King in Black'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and was originally content to drift through the endless void until the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]] arrived and began creating the 7th iteration of the Marvel Universe. Awakened by the "Light of the Creation" and outraged by his kingdom of darkness being despoiled, Knull retaliated by creating All-Black the Necrosword and killing one of the Celestials. Seeing this, the other Celestials banished Knull and the severed head deeper into the Void. He then used the head to forge the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] and combined it with the cosmic energies of the head, which would eventually become [[Knowhere]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1022604840051109888|title = Yep! The severed celestial head in VENOM #4 would someday erode and decay and become Knowhere! Good catch!|last = Cates|first = Donny|publisher = [[Twitter]]|date = 26 July 2018 |website = twitter.com|access-date = 27 July 2018}}</ref> In doing so, he unintentionally gave the symbiotes their weaknesses to sonic attacks and fire. He created a symbiote armor and, with All-Black, started killing the other [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|deities]], until he crash-landed on an unnamed planet where [[Gorr the God Butcher|Gorr]] took All-Black from the incapacitated Knull.<ref>''Thor God of Thunder'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Knull eventually reawakened and discovered he could bond his living abyss to "lesser creatures" and control their new form as vessels. He created an army of symbiotes with himself in the center of the hive mind and uses them to spread over the universe, establishing the Symbiote Hive and killing the light and creation in the process.

He continued killing gods, while also enslaving others whom he spared with the use of his abyss. At some point, he was approached by the time-displaced [[Silver Surfer]], who had been weakened after the Surfer had created a little star in order to free a world from Knull's control. After a brief fight, Knull was able to bond a symbiote to the Surfer, but the latter was saved by [[Ego, the Living Planet]].<ref>''Silver Surfer: Black'' #1-2. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Knull reached the Surfer, he tried to defeat him and re-infect the Surfer with his abyss, but the Surfer, who had gathered the energy of the cosmos, created a star which was enough to defeat Knull.<ref>''Silver Surfer: Black'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When one dragon-like symbiote arrived on medieval Earth to claim the planet as part of the Symbiote Hive, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] arrived in aid of the Viking villagers and defeated the dragon, which the villagers called "Grendel", causing the connection between Knull and the symbiote hivemind to break. The symbiotes that were scattered over the universe, now free from Knull's control, began bonding to benevolent hosts and learning about the [[Divine light|Light]]. The symbiotes rebelled against their god and trapped him inside an artificial planet formed of billions of symbiotes, which they called Klyntar — "cage" in their language.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After thousands of years, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] discovered the body of the Grendel and bound the pieces of the dragon to soldiers in order to create Super-Soldiers to fight in the [[Vietnam War]]. The procedure was dubbed the [[Weapon Plus#Weapon V|Sym-Soldier program]]. This reawakened Knull, allowing him to take control of the Sym-soldiers who went rogue before being captured by [[Nick Fury]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]], except one piece, named Rex, which escaped Knull's control.<ref>''Web of Venom Ve'nam'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Years later, [[Eddie Brock]] ([[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]) unknowingly freed the dragon and, after a battle against Eddie and [[Miles Morales|Spider-Man]], the dragon began searching for Rex in order to free Knull.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Venom merged with Rex and eventually trapped the Grendel in a blast furnace, incinerating it and Rex both.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #5-6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterward, the Maker and Project Oversight retrieve the Grendel's codex from the furnace.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''Carnage Born'', after [[Scorn (Marvel Comics)|Scorn]] joined a cult worshiping Knull, they stole the Grendel's codex and Cletus' deceased body and, after implanting the codex inside Cletus, the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage symbiote]]'s codex is absorbed by Grendel, causing Grendel to become god-like. After the contact with Knull, Cletus decided to free Knull by collecting every codex of every host who had at some point bonded to symbiotes in order to overload the symbiote hive mind and scatter the Klyntar.<ref>''Web of Venom Carnage Born'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Cletus reunited with [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], they reformed the cult dedicated in worshiping Knull and returned to Doverton, Colorado, where they got the codices from the citizens and animals who were infected by Carnage during ''Carnage USA''.<ref>''Web of Venom Cult of Carnage'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During "[[Absolute Carnage]]", as Carnage grew stronger, so did the connection between Knull and the symbiotes, as witnessed when [[Phage (comics)|Phage]], [[Agony (comics)|Agony]], [[Lasher (comics)|Lasher]], [[Riot (comics)|Riot]] and [[Scream (comics)|Scream]] also became corrupt.<ref>''Absolute Carnage: Separation Anxiety'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref><ref>''Absolute Carnage: Scream'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> Knull was finally reawakened after Dark Carnage tricked Eddie into killing him after claiming the remaining codices. Knull promptly destroyed Klyntar and, manifesting a suit of draconic armor and coalescing its constituent symbiotes into a fleet of symbiote-dragons. Meanwhile Knull was tracked down by [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Wraith]], who wanted Knull to remove the Exolon (parasites that attach to a host while feeding on their soul) from his body.<ref>''Guardians of Galaxy'' Vol 5 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Knull revealed to Wraith that Exolons were just his failed experiments on symbiotes and he dumped that "trash" in The Exoteric Latitude, though he striped the Exolon from Wraith's body and turned it into his sword while kicked off Wraith into the space.<ref>''Web of Venom: Wraith'' #1</ref> Soon, he resumed his campaign against the light all the while journeying to Earth,<ref>''Absolute Carnage'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> using his living abyss to claim entire planets to his cause,<ref>''Incoming'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> while haunting Eddie Brock with pointed nightmares<ref>''Venom'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> and briefly imposed his influence over Dylan Brock to ensure that he would pledge allegiance to the Symbiote Imperium.<ref>''Venom'' #22</ref><ref>''Web of Venom: The Good Son'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At the time when the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] were investigating the death of Zn'rx Emperor Stote during the Galactic Council's meeting at the Proscenium and find that the [[Chitauri]] Peacekeeper and the Profiteer were responsible sometime after the events of the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, Zoralis Gupa of the planet Silnius takes an urgent call while mentioning to the person on the other side to warn all neighboring systems. He tells Victoria that it's the End of Everything as different planets are starting to die in the planets owned by the Shi'ar, the Kree/Skrull Alliance, and the Zn'rx while rendering the galactic economy fragile enough to go bankrupt. Knowing that she won't make a profit, the Profiteer teleports Peacekeeper and the bio-bomb away. While thanking Zoralis Gupa for fooling the Profiteer with the bluff, Zoralis Gupa states to Super-Skrull and everyone present that something darker than [[Galactus]] is destroying the worlds and its name is Knull.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 6 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Emperor [[Hulkling]] dispatched [[Talos the Untamed|Talos]] to investigate the Kree and Skrull bases that went dark with Av-Rom, Keeyah, M'lanz, Virtue, and Tarna. Two days later, a Kree/Skrull Alliance armada headed by General Kalamari finds Talos' escape pod. After recuperating in the sick bay, Talos recaps to Kalamari about what happened on his mission that involved an encounter with [[Knull]]. Talos then informs Kalamari that his distress beacon on his escape pod is a warning that Knull is coming. Outside the ship, Knull is riding a Symbiote Dragon as he swoops in for an attack.<ref>''Web of Venom: Empyre's End'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
{{See|Symbiote (comics)#Powers and abilities}}
Knull is a primordial deity, having super strength, agility, immortality<ref>{{cite tweet |user= Doncates|number= 1120132305777983489|date= 21 April 2019|title= Nothing can kill Knull}}</ref> and healing factor. He possesses Supreme Umbrakinesis, as he can manifest darkness to create weapons and creatures, whom he calls the "Living Abyss", which he can control and also augment their power which allowed Venom to unlock new abilities and also allowed one of Knull's dragon to be unaffected by the symbiotes' classic weaknesses and to be as fast as the Silver Surfer. He also possesses limited shapeshifting ability, including the ability to turn his human-like mouth into fanged jaws with an elongated tongue — this feature was passed on to the symbiotes. He's also an expert combatant, utilizing All-Black to kill [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]] and other [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|gods]], while wearing an armor made from symbiote with a red dragon and spiral emblem, which was based on Spiral of [[Carcosa]] from the ''[[True Detective]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stegmanandfriends.podbean.com/e/venom-boiz-wdonny-cates-venom-1-q-and-a//|title=VENOM BOIZ! w/Donny Cates: Venom (2018) #1 Director's Commentary|date=22 June 2019}}</ref>

Despite his connection to the symbiotes being severed, his influence can still be seen such when Gorr, [[Galactus#King Thor|Old Galactus]],<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #24.

== Reception ==
In his early appearance, the character was received well, with [[Comic Book Resources]] drawing comparison with two other Marvel Villains: [[Morlun]] and [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/venom-knull-symbiote-god-explainer|title=Meet Knull, Venom's God of the Symbiotes|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]]|date=27 June 2018|access-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190324111457/https://www.cbr.com/venom-knull-symbiote-god-explainer/|archive-date=24 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> However, Comic Book Resources also criticized the character's design as being unoriginal and similar to most other villains, and not matching his nature, saying that the character would have been better if he would have been more similar to his creation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/venom-knull-remained-hidden/amp/|title=Venom's Symbiote God Should Have Remained in the Shadows|access-date=2020-07-11|website=CBR|first=Timothy|last=Donohoo|date=9 August 2020}}</ref> [[Bleeding Cool]] stated about the history that "It’s an engaging new story, and it redefines the symbiotes for the Marvel Universe."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/07/28/venom-4-review-the-origins-of-knull-and-the-symbiotes/|title=Venom #4 Review: The Origins of Knull and the Symbiotes|publisher=[[Bleeding Cool]]|date=28 July 2018|access-date=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512214504/https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/07/28/venom-4-review-the-origins-of-knull-and-the-symbiotes/|archive-date=12 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Knull was ranked number one in [[IGN]]'s list of ''Marvel's Most Powerful Symbiotes''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.ign.com/articles/2018/10/19/venom-movie-marvels-most-powerful-symbiotes-ranked|title=Marvel's most powerful symbiotes|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=19 October 2018|access-date=19 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520021523/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/19/venom-movie-marvels-most-powerful-symbiotes-ranked|archive-date=20 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The character received special attention in Sweden and Norway due to the word "knull" being the noun form of "fuck" (referring to copulation) in Swedish and Norwegian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/knull-venom-3-spoilers/|title=The Rather Sweary True Meaning of Knull|date=June 30, 2018|access-date=2020-07-02|website=Bleeding Cool|last=Johnston|first=Rich|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200702202541/https://bleedingcool.com/comics/knull-venom-3-spoilers/|archive-date=2 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.expressen.se/dinapengar/knull-is-coming-akta-er-for-marvel-comics-superbov/|title="Knull is coming" – akta er för Marvel Comics superbov|date=July 2, 2020|access-date=2020-07-02|website=[[Expressen]]|last=Dahlskog|first=Noréa|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200702203111/https://www.expressen.se/dinapengar/knull-is-coming-akta-er-for-marvel-comics-superbov/|archive-date=2 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Marvel Comics: "Knull is coming – 2020"|url=https://www.vg.no/i/g75Qy5|access-date=2020-07-03|website=www.vg.no|language=nb}}</ref>
