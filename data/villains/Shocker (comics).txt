The '''Shocker''' ('''Herman Schultz''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is usually depicted as an enemy of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]], and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his [[List of Spider-Man enemies|rogues' gallery]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.|John Romita Sr]], the character debuted in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #46 (March 1967). 

Herman Schultz, a [[Autodidacticism|self-taught]] engineer, started out as a low-level burglar and [[Safe-cracking|safe cracker]], before using his skills to build a pair of gauntlents that can produce [[shock wave]]s, which eased his line of work. He later incorporated these gauntlents into a special costume and became a supervillain, quickly rising through the ranks of the [[New York City]] underworld and being employed by various [[Crime boss|crime lords]]. Unlike most Spider-Man villains, who seek power, revenge against the hero, or to create chaos, Shocker is interested in making a living from his criminal career, and only harms those who get in his way. For this reason, he is among Spider-Man's least psychotic, ambitious, and respected adversaries.

The character has been featured in various media adaptations, such as [[feature films]], [[television series]] and [[video games]]. The character made his live-action debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), portrayed by [[Bokeem Woodbine]]. [[IGN]] ranked him as Spider-Man's 23rd greatest enemy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 25 Spider-Man Villains|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-spider-man-villains|website=IGN}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Herman Schultz was born in [[New York City]]. He was a [[high school]] [[wikt:dropout|dropout]] who had brilliant talents as both an inventor and an engineer. Instead of using such talents to gain legitimate employment, he became a successful burglar and the world's best [[safe-cracking|safe-cracker]] (according to him in later stories). After finally being caught and incarcerated for his crimes, he developed a pair of gauntlets designed to shoot air blasts, vibrating at high frequency.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=315–316}}</ref> Schultz uses his gauntlets to escape from prison and becomes the supervillain known as "the Shocker".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=121}}</ref> He defeats [[Spider-Man]] in their first confrontation (Spider-Man was at a disadvantage due to having a bad left arm sprain from an earlier battle with the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #44–45</ref>) during a robbery. While robbing a bank, he was later beaten and sent back to prison after Spider-Man pinned Schultz's thumbs away from the gauntlets' triggers with the webbing and then knocked him out.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #46</ref>

Shocker later stole an ancient stone tablet with an inscription for a formula that could restore youth, that had been earlier stolen by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #72</ref> Likely Schultz's most ambitious solo exploit was his attempt to hold [[New York City]] for ransom by blacking out various electrical grids to spell out his name, and extort one million dollars from the city.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #151–152</ref> He then made one million dollars by harassing a stock broker.<ref>''Defenders'' #64</ref> Shocker later joined [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]]'s [[Masters of Evil]] (with [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Karla Sofen|Moonstone]], and the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]]) to incriminate [[Hank Pym|Dr. Henry Pym]], then on trial for treason. The Masters battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in this encounter; Shocker was brainwashed and purposely abandoned by Egghead to deliver a false testimony,<ref>''Avengers'' #228</ref> and subsequently cooperated with the authorities in exonerating the ex-Avenger.<ref>''Avengers'' #229</ref>

Shocker was later hired by the Nazi war criminal Baron Von Lundt to kill [[Dominic Fortune]], and built the vibro-shock units into his entire uniform to do so.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #10</ref> Shocker was hired by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] to induce [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] to join their organization.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #157</ref> Shocker later attempted to steal thousands of charity dollars at the celebrity fund raiser for the New York City Library.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #335</ref> He's captured by Spider-Man and sent to prison. He later escapes with the help of fellow inmate [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]]. By this time, he's developed severe confidence issues and has become terrified that the [[Scourge of the Underworld]] is going to kill him. A tipping point occurs when Spider-Man apprehends him and seems to not take him seriously. Enraged, Shocker defeats Spider-Man and is about to finish him off when a Scourge imposter intervenes, causing Shocker to flee.<ref>''The Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1–3</ref> When he next appeared his confidence issues are gone. He aims to hunt down Scourge himself and kill him first.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #364</ref>

Shocker has proven to be a constant presence among Spider-Man's gallery of enemies. He often works as a member of a team (including [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]'s [[Sinister Six#Sinister Seven|Sinister Seven]], [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Sinister Six#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]], [[Doctor Octopus]]'s most recent [[Sinister Six#Civil War's Sinister Six|Sinister Six]], and the [[Masters of Evil]]) or in partnership with at least one other villain. Previous alliances include Boomerang, the Beetle, [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Leila Davis]], [[Hydro-Man]], and [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]] (all of which made up the [[Sinister Syndicate]]), and the [[Trapster]], [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. He also teamed up with a large group of villains during the [[Acts of Vengeance]], when he helped them unsuccessfully attack the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #334</ref> During one of his team-ups with Doctor Octopus, he participated in a raid on [[Avengers Mansion]], hoping to help conquer it as the heroes were distracted by the events of [[the Infinity War]]. Shocker was forced to fight alongside the heroes called the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] when alien doubles of both sides attacked. After the doubles stopped coming, Doctor Octopus tried to order Shocker and the others to continue fighting the heroes but instead, they turned on Doctor Octopus. They did not wish to harm the people who had helped save their lives. Shocker helped chase Doctor Octopus out of the building.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #28–29</ref>

At one point in his career, Shocker became increasingly paranoid that he was on the [[Scourge of the Underworld]]'s hit list, even though there was no actual proof that he was.<ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1</ref> He thus started seeking ways to become more powerful, hoping to thwart any attempt on his life by the vigilante group.{{issue|date=September 2012}} Shocker somehow acquired actual superhuman vibration powers. As he becomes more powerful, he realizes that the new powers will eventually kill him. He seeks a vibrational harness to cure himself and is aided by [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]] and Spider-Man.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #109</ref>

Shocker has had Spider-Man on the ropes on several occasions, with timely interventions often saving Spider-Man. Individuals thwarting Shocker's victories over Spider-Man include security guards, Dominic Fortune, and even a Scourge of the Underworld impostor. Shocker has also let Spider-Man go on a few occasions, the first being when he found Spider-Man incapacitated with a bout of vertigo on the outside of a tall building. He doesn't kill Spider-Man, thinking it an unworthy end, but doesn't help him either.<ref>''Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #83</ref> Shocker found another moment of victory over Spider-Man when he teamed up with the Trapster. Sent by the [[Friends of Humanity]] to assassinate [[Spider-Man supporting characters#Gwen Stacy's family|Paul Stacy]], the duo managed to glue Stacy and Spider-Man together and corner them, only to be called off their assignment moments before finishing them off.<ref>''Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #85–87</ref> Shocker would later turn on the Trapster at the behest of Osborn of having Trapster eliminated as a potential witness against his recent attempt to frame Spider-Man for murder. Preparing to kill the resigned Trapster in an alley, he was attacked and rendered unconscious at the last minute by Spider-Man (then disguised under the alias [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]]).<ref>''Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #91</ref>

Shocker has a run-in with [[Iron Man]] on a subway car in NYC.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3 #42</ref> Shocker is hired by the [[Golem (comics)|Golem]], along with Constrictor and Jack O'Lantern, to protect a diamond delivery. He battles the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]].<ref>''The Hood'' #1–6</ref> Shocker was terminated as a freelance agent by [[Justin Hammer|Hammer Industries]] and captured by Spider-Man while trying to rob a federal bank alongside Hydro-Man. He accidentally evaporates his water-based ally with a misplaced vibration.<ref>''Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #51–52</ref> He allied himself with Speed Demon of the New [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in order to break into a particularly well-guarded safe. Though the police arrived at his hide-out in quick pursuit, he was saved by Speed Demon dashing in and stealing both the loot and Shocker's weapons, removing all traces of evidence (and, unfortunately for Shocker, also keeping the money to fund the Thunderbolts' further activities).<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #8</ref> Shocker plays a small role in the "[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]" crossover event.<ref>''Secret War'' #3–5</ref> A new version of the [[Sinister Six]], with Shocker as a member, bands together during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] but were stopped by [[Captain America]] and his [[Civil War (comic book)#Plot synopsis|Secret Avengers]].<ref>''Civil War'' #3</ref>

In ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' #4, he was among the group of villains that the Punisher attempts to kill at the wake of the recently deceased [[Stilt-Man]]. He survives the poisoning and fire-bombing. He later appears in ''[[She-Hulk]]'' #17 and later again in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #3, in which he was shown to have partially reformed the Sinister Syndicate alongside Hydro-Man and Boomerang. This group attempts to rob Baily's Auction House but are interrupted by Spider-Man and then Initiative members [[War Machine]] and [[Komodo (comics)#Character from Avengers: The Initiative|Komodo]]. The latter are there to neutralize Spider-Man. The trio escapes, only to be found and attacked by government operatives called 'Scarlet Spiders'.

In his first ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' appearance, he is shown to have been hired by a mobster to take out a subway train wagon full of jurors. After a brief battle with Spider-Man, he is knocked unconscious while Spider-Man uses his gauntlets to destroy rubble blocking the path. Although he seems cooperative at first, as soon as he is secured by Spider-Man, he activates a powerful shock in his gauntlets through his belt, causing the main exit to collapse and allowing him to escape.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #578–579</ref> On their way to collect money from bets on superhero fights, Shocker and Boomerang discover the dead body of "the Bookie".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #584</ref> Shocker later appeared as a member of Hood's crime syndicate.<ref>''Dark Reign: The Hood'' #4–5</ref>

During the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Shocker is invited by Doctor Octopus to rejoin the reestablished [[Sinister Six]], where he exchange for securing some specific items. He and Tombstone went after [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant in the restaurant shop, until Spider-Man interfered.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref> After he passes out from his fight, the police arrive but Shocker is carried away by Tombstone, who escapes.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #644</ref> When Spider-Man goes on a rampage against the villains after the infant was stolen by Chameleon, Shocker is attacked in his hideout and threatens Shocker to tell him everything about the villains' whereabouts. Shocker tells Spider-Man that Chameleon has the baby at the Kravinoff Mansion.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645</ref> Shocker was then seen in the Raft due to a popular online vote at Marvel.com<ref>http://marvel.com/news/story/14891/choose_the_next_thunderbolt</ref> and was selected to join the Thunderbolts's new Beta team called the Underbolts where it was revealed that [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-V]] has put his name on the list of likely candidates.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #156</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Spider-Man and [[Carlie Cooper]] encounter a six-armed Shocker. During the fight, Shocker reveals that he wants the money so that [[Mad Thinker]] can cure him. Shocker then pulls off his mask to reveal that he's slowly mutating into a spider-like creature.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #669</ref> Shocker later appeared as a member of Villains for Hire (a villain counterpart of [[Heroes for Hire]]).<ref>''Villains for Hire'' #1</ref>

As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, Shocker appears as a member of the latest incarnation of the [[Sinister Six]], consisting of himself, [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Janice Lincoln|Lady Beetle]], [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]], [[Overdrive (comics)|Overdrive]], and the [[Living Brain]].<ref>''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]'' #1</ref> Shocker features as one of the main characters in ''[[The Superior Foes of Spider-Man]]'', which concludes with [[Silvermane]] crowning him the new don of the New York underworld after Shocker saves dozens of mobsters by singlehandedly defeating the [[Punisher]].<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = Nick Spencer| penciller = Steve Lieber| inker = Steve Lieber| story = Goodbye, Farewell and Good Riddance| title = The Superior Foes of Spider-Man| volume = 1| issue = #17| date = November 26, 2014| publisher = Marvel Comics| location = United States}}</ref> Shocker shares a meal with [[She-Hulk]] while they discuss a memory Jennifer cannot remember, and Herman helps her by telling what little he remembers because she treated him well and bought him lunch, whereas other heroes would just beat him up and ask questions later.<ref>''She-Hulk Vol. 3'' #5</ref> It was then revealed that a villain named Nighteater created a spell that would murder hundreds of people but made everyone think he was not a villain, but was instead a hero named [[Nightwatch (comics)|Nightwatch]], because it was more profitable. When Shocker found out, he assisted She-Hulk in defeating Nightwatch. When asked by Nightwatch why Shocker was angry after already getting his cut, even if he had forgotten, Shocker said that it was because he wanted to be a hero too.<ref>''She-Hulk Vol. 3'' #12</ref>

When New York City was covered in the darkforce dome by the evil [[Captain America]], the Shocker and [[Scorpia (comics)|Scorpia]] took advantage of this by robbing a bank but was stopped by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]].<ref>''Uncanny Avengers Vol. 3'' #24</ref> When the Shocker accidentally crushes the ground beneath them, they were surrounded by darkforce creatures and had no choice but to work together.

==Characterization==
===Powers and abilities===
The Shocker wears a pair of gauntlets he designed with vibro-shock units known as "vibro-smashers" that, when activated by a pump-action thumb trigger, can project a concentrated blast of compressed air that vibrates at an intense frequency. This creates a series of rapid-succession high-pressure air blasts that result in a series of powerful impacts. This allows Shocker to both effectively throw long range vibrational punches from a distance, creating destructive vibrations that can crumble solid concrete and cause extensive damage to the human body and its internal organs, as well as throw shock waves which vibrate the structure of something in order to weaken or destroy it. A lesser known ability of the gauntlets allows Shocker to make incredible leaps, by directing the air blasts toward the ground in front of him. Holding the thumb triggers down for an extended period of time increases the intensity, speed, and even spread of the air blasts.

The feedback from the Shocker's gauntlets is extremely intense (the initial test almost killed him). To guard himself from this, he developed a protective costume consisting largely of yellow quilt patches designed to absorb the shock. The costume is made of foam-lined synthetic fabric which absorbs all vibrations and establishes a vibrational shield which deflects normal blows and allows him to slip from any grasp. The costume's appearance has been the source of ridicule on the part of Spider-Man and other characters. How fellow villain the [[Looter (comics)|Looter]] was able to once wield one of the gauntlets without wearing a protective costume and suffering injury is unclear, though his super strength and durability were presumably a factor. Despite having no superhuman abilities, his vibrating suit and gauntlets enable him to trade blows with Spider-Man.

Around the year 2000 ([[real time (media)#Comic books and strips|real time]]), Herman Schultz began upgrading the abilities of his costume and weapons. His suit now contains a number of built-in shock units, which throw up a protective vibrational field when triggered by accompanying motion detectors. Besides deflecting most physical blows, this makes it difficult, if not impossible for someone to physically assault or grasp him by surprise. This power upgrade was accompanied by a much bulkier and more protective looking costume (as designed by artist [[John Romita, Jr.]]).

He also recently allowed [[Justin Hammer|Hammer Industries]] to drastically upgrade the power of his gauntlets. However, not trusting to share the whole of his secrets (and thus become what he perceives as expendable), he refused Hammer's technicians access to his actual costume, which (at least at the time) likely wasn't providing him with thorough protection from the feedback of the upgraded gauntlets (he cited nosebleeds as a risk he was willing to take).

Shocker has since appeared repeatedly in his original costume and minus the redesigned super-gauntlets provided to him by Hammer Industries. Whether or not this means he has found a way to retain his upgraded abilities in his old costume or whether he no longer uses them remains in question.

===Personality===
While most Spider-Man villains usually shift from their original goals to a vendetta against Spider-Man, the Shocker is still concerned largely with making a living and protecting his reputation. As such, the character is usually portrayed as behaving in a more professional manner than the majority of his maniacal peers.<ref>''The Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #16</ref>

Shocker has a notably rational personality among Spider-Man's enemies. He has often been shown to recognize his own limitations amongst a universe of super-powered individuals. He was once stricken with chronic anxiety and paranoia (in the ''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' series) stemming from his fears about being targeted by anti-heroes [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] and the [[Punisher]] (surprisingly, he has survived encounters with both). While partnered with the Trapster, he mentions that he engages in [[psychotherapy]].

In recent stories ("Venomous" and "Senseless Violence"), Shocker has revealed that he is extremely frustrated with his place in life, not wanting to be known as a punching bag for superheroes like Spider-Man. He unsuccessfully attempts to purchase the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] at an auction to gain some respect. When temporarily partnered with [[Hydro-Man]], he rebukes Morrie's suggestion that they go kill Spider-Man, being far more interested in more financially lucrative ventures and trying to rebuild a professional reputation.

==Other characters named Shocker==
===Dalt Kendall===
'''Dalt Kendall''' was a brilliant scientist who was obsessed with [[electric eel]]s. He began breeding a pair of gigantic electric eels in his secret lab, slowly exposing himself to their electricity. Over time his body developed an immunity to electricity and the ability to discharge electricity at will. Using his new powers, he began a life of crime, calling himself the Shocker. [[Madeline Joyce]] witnessed his first robbery and in her costumed identity of [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]], attempted to apprehend the Shocker. Shocker managed to evade capture several times before Miss America finally discovered the entrance to his secret lab. Once he discovered she was in his hideout, Shocker began to divulge the source of his powers before taking the opportunity to attack the heroine. Miss America then tricked him into thinking she was unconscious and struck back at him, punching him into his pet eel aquarium. Somehow, the eel's electricity killed him while unconscious even though he had the ability to harmlessly absorb their electricity otherwise.<ref>''Miss America Magazine'' #2 (November 1944)</ref>

===Randall Darby===
{{main|Randall Darby}}
Randall Darby is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who took the Shocker codename after being recruited by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] to become a member of his [[Brotherhood of Mutants]],<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #4</ref> but after Magneto abandoned him, Darby changes his code name to Paralyzer.<ref>''Captain America'' #343</ref>

==Other versions==
===''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows''===
During the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline in the pages of ''[[Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows]]'', Shocker appears as an enforcer of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: R#Regent|Regent]] where he is seen assisting Boomerang and Rhino in beating up [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]]. He later appears as a member of the Sinister Six when they are tasked to hunt down Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===MC2===
While the Shocker has not actually appeared in the MC2 universe, his gauntlets have been seen in the use of the bounty hunter [[Mad Dog Rassitano]].

===''JLA/Avengers''===
In ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', the Shocker is among the mind-controlled villains who attack the heroes as they assault [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s stronghold. He is defeated by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]].<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of Shocker is 33-year-old petty crook Herman Schultz who raids money transports.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #8</ref> He wears a purple trench coat and a pair of goggles to protect his eyes. He used to work at [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Industries]] and invented his weapons there.<ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #122">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #122</ref> He was fired later and then became the Shocker to "get what he deserves" for all the work he has done. He is not especially dangerous and has fought [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] five times in the first 100 issues. During several, there was an unusual factor: Spider-Man wearing the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|black suit]],<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #35</ref> or the presence of [[Kitty Pryde]],<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #112</ref> or [[Wolverine (Ultimate Marvel character)|Wolverine]] putting Shocker at a disadvantage.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #67</ref> Ultimately, he suffers five embarrassing defeats. Thus, he perpetually ends up in jail and his equipment is confiscated. However, he somehow manages to get a new set every time he escapes. It was shown in ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'' that he does make new vibration units in the machine shop of the prison. It is also implied that he isn't always [[indictment|charged]] with anything; Spider-Man simply leaves him at the crime scene. This was noted in their encounter in the second annual when [[Foggy Nelson]] advised Spider-Man to hand him over to the police rather than leave him on the ground.{{issue|date=June 2012}} He is seen in the annual being dropped off at a police station while crying.{{issue|date=June 2012}} He gets some measure of revenge, where he unexpectedly defeats, captures, and tortures Spider-Man, and relays his background. He studied at MIT vigorously and eventually secured a job at Roxxon Industries creating high-end weaponry before being cheated out of his work and earnings. With Spider-Man as his only outlet for rage, he proceeds to assault him before once again being arrested by the authorities led by NYPD's Captain Frank Quaid after a tip from Kitty and [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #122"/>

===''What If''===

In his first appearance during the three-part episode, "The Alien Costume", he was hired by the Kingpin to eliminate [[Eddie Brock]] to ensure the [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]]'s theft of the Promethium X asteroid was not compromised. Due to [[Spider-Man]]'s arrival, however, Brock escaped Shocker's wrath and the Promethium X was taken back. When Shocker learned of this, he kidnapped [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] and demanded Spider-Man give him the asteroid in exchange. The two met in a church tower and got into a fight after Jameson escaped. Spider-Man eventually won after disabling Shocker's gauntlets, though the web-slinger nearly killed the villain due to the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote suit]]'s influence at the time. When Spider-Man returned to his original costume, Shocker and Rhino attempted to take advantage and joined forces to kill the web-slinger, only to be defeated by [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. The two villains ended up in jail, but the Kingpin broke them out in the episodes, "The Insidious Six" and "Battle of the Insidious Six", to join the [[Sinister Six|eponymous group]] and kill Spider-Man, though they failed to do so. While the group disbanded and rejected Kingpin, Shocker returned in the episode "The Awakening", having been hired by Kingpin to work with Dr. [[Herbert Landon]] to kidnap [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]]. They succeeded, but Morbius escaped with help from Spider-Man and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]].

The heroes later learn he was a brainwashed pawn of [[Mesmero]], who used Shocker, [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], and [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]] to assist him in his crimes, though Spider-Man was able to free the villains from Mesmero's control and leave them for the police.
