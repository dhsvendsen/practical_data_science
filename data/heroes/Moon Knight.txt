'''Moon Knight''' ('''Marc Spector''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Doug Moench]] and artist [[Don Perlin]], the character first appeared in ''[[Werewolf by Night]]'' #32 (August [[1975 in comics|1975]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=247}}</ref>

Marc Spector is a former [[Boxing|boxer]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]], and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative who becomes [[mercenary]]. During a job in the Sudan, he is appalled by ruthless fellow mercenary [[Bushman (comics)|Raoul Bushman]] who kills Dr. Alraune, an archeologist, so he can loot a recently uncovered tomb. Spector saves Alraune's daughter and colleague Marlene Alraune. He attempts to stop Bushman but is defeated and left for dead. After the dying Spector is brought into the unearthed tomb for shelter, he inexplicably revives to full health, claiming he has been resurrected by the Egyptian moon god [[Khonshu (Marvel Comics)|Khonshu]] to be his avatar on Earth, the "moon's knight" who protects and avenges the innocent. It is later revealed Khonshu is real, one of several entities from the Othervoid (a dimension outside normal time and space) who were worshipped as gods by ancient Earth people. Khonshu had chosen Marc when the latter was a young boy, creating a psychic connection between them, and waited until he was ready. On his return to the [[United States]], Spector invests his mercenary profits into becoming the crimefighter "Moon Knight", aided by his colleague Jean-Paul "Frenchie" DuChamp and Marlene Alraune, who becomes his lover. Along with his costumed alter ego, he also uses two other identities to help gain information from different social circles: millionaire '''Steven Grant''' and [[taxicab]] driver '''Jake Lockley'''. Several times in his life, Marc shows symptoms similar to [[dissociative identity disorder]] (incorrectly referred to as [[schizophrenia]] in some stories). It is debated whether Marc's mental disorder is caused by childhood trauma or "brain damage" resulting from his psychic connection to Khonshu, a connection that compels Moon Knight's mind to shift into different personalities based on the four major aspects of the moon god's multi-faceted nature ("the traveler", "the pathfinder", "the embracer", and "the defender of those who travel at night").<ref>''Moon Knight'' (vol. 4) #1 (Marvel Comics, 2014).</ref>

In most of his stories, Moon Knight has no supernatural abilities beyond occasional visions of mystical insight. He relies on athletic ability, intelligence, advanced technology, and expert combat skills. Since becoming Moon Knight, Marc Spector has seemingly died again and then been resurrected each time by Khonshu. It's unknown how many times Khonshu may resurrect the hero. For a time, Moon Knight's strength could reach superhuman levels depending on the phases of the moon, but this ability later vanished.<ref>''Moon Knight: Fist of Khonshu'' #1-6 (Marvel Comics, 1985).</ref>

The character has made appearances in various media outside of comics, including animated series and video games. Moon Knight will make his live-action debut in ''[[Moon Knight (TV series)|Moon Knight]]'', an upcoming [[Disney+]] television series centered around the character, set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] with [[Oscar Isaac]] starring in the title role.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-01-07|title=Moon Knight Cinematographer Confirms Oscar Isaac's Role in the Disney+ Series|url=https://www.cbr.com/moon-knight-cinematographer-confirms-oscar-isaac-disney-plus-role/|access-date=2021-01-14|website=CBR|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> The character was ranked by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine as the 149th-greatest comic book character of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herochat.com/forum/index.php?topic=170859.0 |title=Wizard's top 200 characters.

==Publication history==
The character debuted in ''[[Werewolf by Night]]'' #32 (August 1975), written by [[Doug Moench]] with art by [[Don Perlin]] and [[Al Milgrom]], as a mercenary hired by the Committee to capture the title character. The creative team give Moon Knight moon-related symbology and silver weapons (a metal poisonous to a werewolf) to mark him as suitable antagonist for the werewolf hero. Believing the werewolf Jack Russell to be a menace, Moon Knight agrees to the job. The two-part story continues into #33,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020 |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/moonkngt.htm |title=Moon Knight}}</ref> when Moon Knight discovers the Committee wants to use Russell as a weapon. Realizing Russell is a victim, Moon Knight helps the werewolf escape. Moon Knight later returned as a demonic apparition in ''Werewolf by Night'' #37 (March 1976).

Editors [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Len Wein]] liked the character, prompting them to grant him a solo spot in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #28–29 (June/August 1976),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Buttery|first=Jarrod|title=Ready for the Spotlight|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=8 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> again written by Doug Moench with art by Don Perlin. The story, along with the Bill Mantlo-penned ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #22 and #23 (September/October 1978), recast Moon Knight as a more heroic character. His association with the evil Committee during his first appearance was now retconned to have been the result of an undercover mission to learn more about the villains. Subsequent appearances came in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #52, written by [[Steven Grant]] with art by Jim Craig. In ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' #47–51, Moon Knight briefly joined the Defenders during their war against the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac Cartel]].

Moon Knight appeared in recurring backup stories in ''Hulk! Magazine'' #11–15, #17–18, and #20, as well as a black and white story in the magazine publication ''Marvel Preview'' #21, all written by Doug Moench. Artist [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] drew Moon Knight in ''Hulk! Magazine'' issues #13–15, 17–18, and #20, creating a new look for the character heavily influenced the art style of [[Neal Adams]], who at that time was most popular for his work on ''Batman'' and ''Green Lantern/Green Arrow'' for DC Comics. This, along with Moon Knight's methods and the atmosphere of his stories, cemented a perception among some readers that he was Marvel's version of [[Batman]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Buchanan|first=Bruce |title=The New Mutants: From Superhero Spin-Off to Sci-Fi/Fantasy|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue= #29|pages=65–66 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> The ''Hulk'' backups and ''Marvel Preview'' issue provided Moon Knight with a partial origin story and introduced recurring villain Randall Spector, who would later become [[Shadow Knight (comics)|Shadow Knight]].

Moon Knight received his first ongoing series in 1980, with [[Doug Moench]] and Bill Sienkiewicz as its main creative team. The character received an expanded origin story in issue #1, which also introduced several recurring characters and arch enemy [[Bushman (comics)|Bushman]]. The series depicted several characters who doubted that the moon god Khonshu was real and believed Marc Spector only experienced a hallucination while near death. It was never explained why other characters, such as Spector's lover Marlene, concluded this when there was no other explanation for Marc's spontaneous recovery from a death-like state and when it was well known by this time that many gods of myth in the Marvel Universe were real, living entities from other dimensions and planets, such as Thor and Zeus.

After early sales were good, Marvel made the ''Moon Knight'' series a flagship title available in comic shops starting with issue #15. The companion mini-series ''Moon Knight: Special Edition'' reprinted the ''Hulk'' and ''Marvel Preview'' Moon Knight stories in color and standard comic format, as opposed to their original magazine format. Sienkiewicz left the series after issue #30, though he continued to contribute covers until the series ended with issue #38.

In 1985, Marvel retooled the character with a new 6-issue mini-series ''Moon Knight'' by [[Alan Zelenetz]] and [[Chris Warner]]. The mini-series, "Fist of Khonshu", depicted Moon Knight now experiencing actual multiple personalities as a result of the stress of maintaining four identities. Although this is similar to [[dissociative identity disorder]] (DID), which used to be referred to as multiple personality disorder (MPD), the story incorrectly associates Moon Knight's symptoms with [[schizophrenia]] because he wonders if he is delusional when he sees Khonshu and the moon god's servants, despite having physical evidence of their presence such as new weaponry. No explanation was given as to why simply using different cover identities would cause Moon Knight such severe symptoms. Along with giving Moon Knight new Egyptian-themed weaponry, this mini-series reveals that Marc Spector's strength now increases in accordance to the phases of the moon.

Following the "Fist of Khonshu" mini-series, Moon Knight appeared in ''Marvel Fanfare'' for two issues (#30 and #38) and then became a regular cast member in ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' (#21–41 and ''Annual''s #1–3), written by [[Steve Englehart]]. When [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] became the series writer, Moon Knight was written out of the [[West Coast Avengers]] team. After a guest spot in ''Punisher Annual'' #2 (part of the "[[Atlantis Attacks]]" storyline), the character was given a new ongoing title in 1989, ''Marc Spector: Moon Knight,'' originally under the direction of writer [[Chuck Dixon]]. Two one-shots, ''Marc Spector: Moon Knight - Special Edition'' #1 and ''Moon Knight: Divided We Fall,'' were published during the run of the title. Dixon then left the series after issue #24, leaving several storylines unresolved such as the fate of Moon Knight's errant sidekick, the second Midnight, who was seemingly killed by the terrorist organization known as the [[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]. Midnight II's fate and plotline were later resolved in the pages of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man|Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #353–358, written by [[Al Milgrom]].

''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' ended with #60 (March 1994). Marc Spector seemingly dies in the issue, sacrificing himself while in battle against a villain called Seth the Immortal. His body is recovered and then buried by his allies. The final story was written by Terry Kavanagh and with art by Stephen Platt, who was then hired by [[Image Comics]] based on the strength of his work during several of the series final issues.

In 1998, a 4-issue mini-series, ''Moon Knight'' vol. 3, was published under writer [[Doug Moench]], artist [[Tommy Edwards]], and inker Robert Campanella. The four part story "Resurrection Wars" has Marc Spector seemingly resurrected again by Khonshu, causing him to materialize alive and well in his home while experiencing a vision of himself rising from the grave and being told by Khonshu that he is once more needed. Marlene and Frenchie witness Marc's return and Marlene finally believes that Khonshu is real and not a delusion, although the possibility is brought up that Marc was not dead but somehow and inexplicably only in a "death-like" state for months.<ref>''Moon Knight Resurrection War'' #1</ref>

In 1999, Moench and artist [[Mark Texeira]] produced ''Moon Knight'' vol. 4, another four-part mini-series which was nominated for the [[Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Award]] for Favorite Limited Series. The title of the story was mistakenly given as "High Strangers" on each cover of the mini-series. The correct title of the four-part story, "High Strangeness", appeared on the title page of each issue.<ref>''Moon Knight: High Strangers'' #1</ref>

A new ongoing series, ''Moon Knight'' vol. 5, launched in April 2006, written by [[Charlie Huston]] with art by [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20100117012349/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=38948 Huston Talks Moon Knight], [[Newsarama]], July 25, 2005</ref> The series revises Marc Spector's history by saying he fought in the [[Gulf War]].

[[Peter Milligan]] wrote a 2008 seasonal one-shot titled ''Moon Knight: Silent Knight'' with artist [[Laurence Campbell]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18868 O Holy Knight: Milligan on Moon Knight Xmas Special], [[Comic Book Resources]], November 18, 2008</ref>

In September 2009, a new series titled ''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' began by writer [[Gregg Hurwitz]] and artist Jerome Opena.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/heroescon-vengeance-of-the-moon-knight/|title=HeroesCon: Vengeance of the Moon Knight! |website=Cbr.com|access-date=29 January 2019}}</ref> ''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' ended with issue #10. Moon Knight became a regular team cast member in ''[[Secret Avengers]]'' #1-21. In Secret Avengers, writer Warren Ellis introduced the idea that Moon Knight sometimes operates without a costume and instead wearing a simple white suit and full white mask. Moon Knight also appeared in the ''Shadowland'' crossover and in the 2010 relaunch of ''[[Heroes for Hire]]''.

In 2011, the series ''Moon Knight'' vol. 7 was launched by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Alex Maleev]]. The series depicted Moon Knight once again experiencing four alters/personalities, though now three of his alters were inexplicably imitations of [[Spider-Man]], [[Captain America]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Due to poor sales, the series was canceled after 12 issues.

In March 2014, the [[Marvel NOW!]] initiative launched ''Moon Knight'' vol. 8. The series involved rotating creative teams that included [[Warren Ellis]] and [[Declan Shalvey]] for issues #1–6, [[Brian Wood (comics)|Brian Wood]] and Greg Smallwood for issues #7–12, and [[Cullen Bunn]] and Ron Ackins for issues #13–17.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/warren-ellis-moon-knight-declan-shalvey-jordie-bellaire-all-new-marvel-now/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234647/http://comicsalliance.com/warren-ellis-moon-knight-declan-shalvey-jordie-bellaire-all-new-marvel-now/ |archive-date=2016-03-03 }}</ref> The series brings back the white suit and tie outfit first seen in ''Secret Avengers'', and now has Moon Knight adopt this outfit when working as a police consultant, answering to "Mr. Knight." With issue #1 of this series, writer Warren Ellis confirmed that Khonshu is a real god or extraterrestrial entity and that Marc Spector had indeed died and been resurrected years ago in the tomb in Egypt. Issue #1 depicted a psychologist confirming that stress and the use of multiple cover identities cannot cause someone to suffer from DID if they did not already suffer from the condition and that Marc's symptoms do not correspond to actual DID. Marc Spector's different personalities are now said to be due to "brain damage," alterations to his brain made by the alien entity Khonshu that connect their minds. These alterations also cause Moon Knight to sometimes shift his personality to match one of the moon god's four distinct roles and facets. These four roles are described as: "pathfinder", "embracer", "defender", and "watcher of overnight travelers." These four roles can manifest in different ways, either with original names or borrowing names and personality traits of people Marc has observed (such as when he briefly acted as if he were Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Captain America).

In April 2016, the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]" initiative included the new series ''Moon Knight'' vol. 9. Written by [[Jeff Lemire]] and artist Greg Smallwood (returning from his run with Brian Wood), the series began having rotating artists with issue #6. After fourteen issues, the series numbering changed to acknowledge it was a continuation of the Moon Knight volumes published before, so issue #15 was instead give the designation #188. This renumbering was done as part of the company-wide [[Marvel Legacy]] initiative. The series then ended with issue #200, which involved contributions from several previously established Moon Knight artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicstore.marvel.com/Moon-Knight-2017-2018-200/digital-comic/49547|title=Moon Knight (2017–2018) #200 – Marvel Comics|website=Comicstore.marvel.com|access-date=29 January 2019}}</ref> In 2019, [[Cullen Bunn]] wrote and Ibrahim Mustafa and Matt Horak drew ''Moon Knight Annual'' #1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aiptcomics.com/2019/09/06/marvel-preview-moon-knight-annual-1/|title=Marvel Preview: Moon Knight Annual #1}}</ref>

Lemire's stories revised Marc's history to show he had first exhibited symptoms of DID and assuming the identity of his alter Steven Grant while still a young boy. The series also showed Khonshu creating a psychic connection between himself and Marc Spector when the latter was still a boy, indicating the moon god may still be responsible for Marc's DID-like condition.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 9 #1-9 (Marvel Comics 2016).</ref> In the series, Khonshu claims he influenced Marc at times over the years, waiting until years later to fully reveal himself. Khonshu then reveals he intends to use Marc as a host body, fully dominating his personality, but Marc refuses. The series has Marc acknowledge that he had exhibited DID symptoms long before assuming the mask of Moon Knight and that his initial insistence his alters were nothing more than cover identities was simply self-denial of his condition.<ref name=":2">''Moon Knight'' vol. 9 #9-10 (Marvel Comics, 2016).</ref>

In ''Avengers'' vol. 8 #33-38 (Marvel Comics, 2020), Khonshu attempts to dominate Earth in order to save it, compelling Moon Knight to help him. A battle with the Avengers results in Khonshu being imprisoned by the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]]. The story was produced by [[Jason Aaron]], Javier Garron, and Jason Keith.

In 2021, the series ''Moon Knight'' vol. 10 launched under writer Jed MacKay, and artists Alessandro Capuccio and Rachelle Rosenberg. The new series has Marc Spector not only acting as the crimefighter Moon Knight but also (despite his Jewish background) adopting the role of high priest of "the Midnight Mission," a congregation dedicated to Khonshu. In discussing his connection to Khonshu, Marc Spector now describes his four aspects as "the traveler", "the pathfinder", "the embracer", "the defender of those who travel at night." Once again, Marc Spector is depicted as being in regular therapy with a psychologist in order to help manage his psychological issues. The series also offers that Marc Spector may be immortal, as he has now been literally resurrected on multiple occasions and could be resurrected again in the future.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Born in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], '''Marc Spector''' is the wayward [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] son of Elias Spector, a [[rabbi]] who survived Nazi persecution. In the Othervoid, a realm outside of normal time and space, the entity Khonshu (once worshipped as a moon god by the people of Ancient Egypt) becomes interested in Marc. Khonshu and those like him cannot leave the Othervoid without great difficulty but can create psychic connections with hosts and avatars in the physical universe of Earth. Believing Marc Spector to have a "weak mind" that makes him vulnerable to psychic connection, Khonshu chooses the boy to one day act as his knight and avatar. After Khonshu chooses Marc, the boy discovers by chance that Rabbi Yitz Perlman, a close friend of his family, is really a Nazi named Ernst who continues to target and murder Jews. Marc fights Perlman and escapes. Perlman then disappears without a trace.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 8 #194 (2019).</ref>

Soon afterward, either because of the trauma of his experience with Perlman or due to the brain damage caused by Khonshu creating a psychic connection between himself and the boy, Marc Spector begins showing signs of [[dissociative identity disorder]]. Marc believes he meets and befriends a boy named '''Steven Grant''', not realizing he himself is acting as Steven at times.<ref name=":2" /> In a vision, Marc sees Khonshu promising to one day heal the boy's mind. Khonshu, being an entity who has multiple aspects to his personality and exists out of phase with normal time and space, later claims Marc's divided personality is the result of his mind trying to echo the moon god's own multi-faceted nature.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 8 #1, ''Moon Knight'' vol. 9 #1-10.</ref>

As a teenager, Marc exhibits another alter in addition to Steve, this one named '''Jake Lockley'''. The appearance of this third personality lead Marc's parents to send him to live at Putnam Psychiatric Hospital. Released to attend his father's funeral, Marc escapes and joins the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], where he becomes a formidable combatant and a trained heavy-weight boxer. After Marc completes multiple tours of duty, the Marines discover he lied on his paperwork and conclude his history of mental illness makes him "unfit for duty."<ref name=":3">''Moon Knight'' vol. 9 #11 (Marvel Comics, 2017).</ref> He is discharged and earns a living as an underground boxer and fighter in Baghdad until he is recruited by [[France|French]] [[Aircraft pilot|pilot]] and mercenary Jean-Paul “[[Frenchie (comics)|Frenchie]]” DuChamp.<ref name=":3" /> The two work together on several assignments. During this time, Spector encounters CIA operative [[Jason Macendale]], who later becomes the costumed mercenary Jack O'Lantern and then becomes the second villain to adopt the name [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]].<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #33 (Marvel Comics, 1991).</ref> Marc's brother [[Shadow Knight (comics)|Randall Spector]] becomes a mercenary as well, but is driven by bloodlust. In Italy, Randall kills Marc's girlfriend Lisa. After a violent confrontation, Marc leaves Randall for dead. Randall later recovers from his injuries.<ref name=":4">''Rampaging Hulk!'' #17–18.

Eventually, Frenchie and Marc meet mercenary [[Bushman (comics)|Raoul Bushman]], who is impressed by their work and recruits them to help with certain jobs.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 9 #12 (Marvel Comics, 2017).</ref> Spector considers that morally he exists in the center between Frenchie, a good man with a firm moral center, and Bushman, a ruthless, often amoral man who takes pride in his ability to kill. Spector and Frenchie accept a contract with Bushman helping a local warlord in the Sudan quell a rebellion. One of the rebels they shoot down is Marc's own brother Randall, though Marc is unaware of this and doesn't even know that Randall is in the area. Despite his bullet wounds, Randall survives, convinced Marc recognized him and deliberately tried to kill him.<ref name=":5">''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #35-38 (Marvel Comics, 1991).</ref>

Marc Spector is appalled at Bushman's bloodlust and that he targets civilians as well as enemy combatants. Bushman kills Dr. Peter Alraune, an archeologist whose team (which includes his daughter Marlene Alraune) recently unearthed a hidden tomb. Bushman intends to loot the tomb and kill any witnesses. Spector scares off Marlene, saving her life, and then engages Bushman in combat. Defeated, Spector is injured and abandoned in the desert without food or shelter, suffering in the freezing temperature of the night. Despite this, he makes his way back to civilization before collapsing, near-death. Locals carry him into the tomb and leave him before a statue of Khonshu, moon god and protector of travelers at night. Marlene realizes Marc saved her life earlier and prepares to mourn him as his heart stops. Moments later, Marc Spector revives, fully healed. He claims to have seen the moon god Khonshu and been chosen to now act as the moon's "knight of vengeance," the "fist of Khonshu." Marlene believes this was a dream or delusion. Marc takes a silver, hooded cloak from the statue of Khonshu, adopting it as his own.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #1 (Marvel Comics, 1985).</ref> Randall watches this all from nearby. As soon as Marc leaves, Randall presents himself to the same statue of Khonshu, hoping to also be blessed with power and have his wounds healed. When nothing happens, he blames Marc for winning the moon god's favor instead.<ref name=":5" />

=== ''Moon Knight'' vol. 1 ===
After confronting and defeating Bushman, Spector returns to America with Frenchie, now joined by Marlene and determined to become a crimefighter called Moon Knight, adopting a white and silver kevlar bodysuit coupled with Khonshu's hooded cloak. When asked why he would wear white and silver while operating at night, Moon Knight answers he is meant to be a light in the darkness and that he and Khonshu want their enemies to know he is coming. To fund his activities and gain influence in business, Spector uses his Steven Grant identity to start a business and make some careful investments, turning his mercenary profits into a small fortune. Buying a mansion for his home base, Spector/Grant then funds the creation of crimefighting equipment and weaponry, including the "Moon Copter." To help gain knowledge from street criminals and civilians, Marc becomes a [[Taxi|taxicab]] driver as Jake Lockley. Lockley quickly makes friends with diner manager Gena Landers, and her sons Ray and Rick. Ray, a pilot, later becomes an ally of Moon Knight, piloting the Moon Copter when Frenchie is unavailable. Moon Knight also befriends Bertrand Crawley, a former textbook salesperson who is now homeless and operates as a street informant.'''<ref name="Marvel Spotlight #28">''Marvel Spotlight'' #28.

Learning of the criminal network known as the Committee, Moon Knight accepts a position with the group and pretends to agree with their agenda. Armed with silver weaponry, Moon Knight is sent to fight the werewolf [[Werewolf by Night|Jack Russell]] in [[Los Angeles]]. After capturing the werewolf, Moon Knight later frees him and together they halt the Committee's plans.<ref>''Werewolf by Night'' #32–33.

Moon Knight fights the Hatchet-Man, who seemingly dies during their battle.<ref name=":4" /> Years later, Moon Knight will learn that the Hatchet-Man who died was an impostor. Randall had used drugs and psychological manipulation to convince the impostor he was the real Randall Spector, even having him undergo plastic surgery so they would be identical. Having faked his death, Randall hides and plans his next move against Marc.<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #35-36 (Marvel Comics, 1992).</ref>

During one adventure, Spector encounters the [[Midnight Man (comics)|Midnight Man]], a thief named Anton Mogart who steals for the thrill and wears a black costume resembling Moon Knight's own suit.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #3 (Marvel Comics).</ref> During his battle with Moon Knight, Midnight Man falls into the New York River, seemingly to his death. In truth, he survives but his face is deformed by acidic sewage. Swearing vengeance, Midnight Man joins forces with Bushman and lures Moon Knight into a trap. Moon Knight survives and Midnight Man escapes again. Later, after gaining a greater sense of peace with his past and his deceased father, Marc Spector decides to largely retire his Moon Knight identity and focus on living a quieter life with Marlene at his side.

===''Moon Knight'' vol. 2 - "Fist of Khonshu" (1985)===
Marlene and Marc Spector set up Spector International Galleries, an art business that curates and organizes collections and exhibits. When Marc Spector has visions of Khonshu summoning him, he decides to return to Egypt and investigate. Convinced Marc is delusional and only thinks he sees visions and hears voices, Marlene leaves him. In Egypt, Spector meets priests of Khonshu who supply him with a new arsenal of [[moon]]-themed weaponry and declare he will now be a true vengeance avatar, the Fist of Khonshu. The moon god then blesses him with increased strength depending on how much moon light shines down on Earth.<ref>''Moon Knight: Fist of Khonshu'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> With his new power and weapons, Moon Knight defeats a villainous priest of Anubis, god of death.

After returning to America, Moon Knight works with the newly formed West Coast Avengers, although this distances him even further from Frenchie and Marlene.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #21</ref> He time travels to 2940 BC to rescue the Avengers, where he gains replacement weapons designed by fellow Avenger [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #23.

Moon Knight and the Avengers are later attacked by soldiers working for Khonshu's rival, [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]], who is invading [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. Khonshu abandons Moon Knight to battle Seth. He then explains it was his wish that Spector join the Avengers and so he influenced Moon Knight's mind to do so. Following Seth's defeat, Moon Knight resigns from the team,<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #41 (February 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref> and reunites with Marlene and Frenchie.<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Moon Knight also gives up the Egyptian themed replacement weapons designed by Hawkeye. This act of independence, and his defiance to remain the Avengers simply because Khonshu wishes it, evidently causes Marc to lose his lunar-based superhuman strength as punishment.<ref name=":1">"[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/moon-knight-9-midnight-sun-chapter-3-for-the-occas/4000-108558/ Moon Knight #9 – Midnight Sun, Chapter 3: For The Occasion]", Marvel, May 1st, 2007</ref>

===''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' (1989–1994)===
After setting up a new home in a mansion in South Hampton, Long Island, NY, Marc Spector expands his business into Spector Enterprises and resumes his activities as Moon Knight, once again with Frenchie and Marlene helping. Soon afterward, he and the Black Cat cross paths with a new thief [[Midnight (Jeff Wilde)|Midnight]] who wears the costume of the Midnight Man. Moon Knight learns the thief is 18-year-old Jeffrey Wilde, son of Anton Mogart. Wilde reveals Mogart discovered he had contracted cancer due to the same chemicals that disfigured him and spent his final days in a hospice, where Wilde tracked him down. The two bonded and learned from each other. Following Mogart's death, Wilde adopted his father's costume and performed dynamic thefts in order to impress Moon Knight, hoping to convince the hero to let him become his sidekick. As Midnight, Wilde hopes to make up for his father's criminal past while finding his own purpose in life.

Despite Moon Knight's protests that he doesn't need a sidekick, Midnight follows him into new adventures and is able to gain some training over the next few weeks during adventures with the [[Punisher]] against [[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]]<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 3 #8–9. Marvel Comics.</ref> and with the mercenaries [[Silver Sable]], [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]].<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> Over time, Wilde concludes Moon Knight's ethics and methods are too much responsibility and that he prefers to pursue excitement. He grows to resent Moon Knight, believing the hero owes him more respect and is responsible for the death of his father (since their battle indirectly led to Mogart being exposed to toxic chemicals).

Marc Spector is kidnapped and brought to the country of Bosqueverde in South America. He is put on trial for his actions while acting as a mercenary during a previous regime change, including causing the death of Ricardo Dominguez, the previous president whom Spector instinctively shot in self defense when the man reached for a gun. Marlene leads a rescue effort with Frenchie. Left alone in New York City, Jeff Wilde performs thefts using Moon Knight's costume and equipment and stumbles onto a meeting between members of the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] terrorist cult. He barely escapes. In Bosqueverde, Spector is found guilty but is able to bargain with the new regime and have his sentence overturned.<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #15-18, "The Trial of Moon Knight" (Marvel Comics).</ref>

Wilde dons a spare Moon Knight costume again and runs into Spider-Man, who realizes he's an impostor. Panicking, Wilde tries to escape only to then be hunted by the Secret Empire. He is saved by Spider-Man and the real Moon Knight. Angry that he panicked and determined to prove himself, Wilde challenges one of the Secret Empire leaders, Number VI, to attack him. Number VI strikes Wilde with an energy blade that burns his body instantly. The Secret Empire then takes Wilde away, leading Moon Knight to pursue, aided by Spider-Man and the Punisher. After facing several Secret Empire agents, the heroes are told that Jeff Wilde died from his injuries and computer records confirm it.<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #19-21 (Marvel Comics).</ref> In truth, the Secret Empire rebuilds Wilde as a cyborg so he can be their living weapon. Blaming Moon Knight for his injuries and abandoning him, as well as for his father's death, Wilde swears revenge. Meanwhile, Moon Knight resumes his activities, though now feeling guilty that he may have been able to prevent Wilde's death if he'd acted differently or had been a better influence on the boy.<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #22-23 (Marvel Comics).</ref>

Moon Knight encounters members of the Knights of the Moon, soldiers of a rogue faction of the Cult of Khonshu. This particular cell of the Knights of the Moon are led by Plasma, a mutant terrorist they believe to be the true chosen champion of Khonshu. Plasma is determined to convince different groups and cults she is their messiah, chosen by various gods, so she can then use her new followers to achieve global domination. Together with [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Ghost Rider]], Moon Knight defeats Plasma's soldiers. Plasma inadvertently causes her own death when she doesn't heed Moon Knight's warning. The experience shakes Moon Knight, leading him to question if he is also misguided in his belief that he follows the will of Khonshu.<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #25 (Marvel Comics, 1991).</ref>

While fighting the lethal vigilante Stained-Glass Scarlet, Moon Knight is seriously injured and then falls into New York's [[East River]] from the top of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. After making impact with the water, Marc experiences visions of both Khonshu and his father, leading him to realize Khonshu is not limited to vengeance and is also a god of justice, offering people redemption just as he was offered the chance to be a hero after years of being a mercenary. Emerging from the water, Marc has already partially recovered from his knife wound. He believes he died from his injuries and the fall but that Khonshu resurrected him once again. Seeing himself now as a light in the darkness rather than simply a warrior, Marc shares his personal story with Scarlet, offering sympathy and redemption if she gives up her crusade and turns herself into the authorities. Believing she has failed God and is unworthy of redemption, Scarlet leaps to her death.<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #26-31, "Scarlet Redemption" (Marvel Comics, 1991).</ref>

Moon Knight learns from Spider-Man that Jeff Wilde AKA Midnight is alive, now operating as a cyborg warrior for the Secret Empire. Believing Wilde is not in his right mind and can be redeemed, Moon Knight tries to rescue him, fighting the Secret Empire alongside the heroes Spider-Man, [[Darkhawk]], the [[Punisher]], [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]]. Encouraged by his nurse Lynn Church (whom he is now in love with), Wilde attempts a coup so he can lead the Secret Empire. During a final climactic battle, Wilde realizes that Lynn Church has been manipulating him and sees him as a weapon. Once again feeling betrayed by those he put faith in, Wilde destroys the Secret Empire's main base in New York City, seemingly killing himself and Church in the process. Moon Knight once again mourns Wilde, regretting that he did not know how to reach the young man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #353–358. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Moon Knight encounters Jacon Macendale (Hobgoblin) while the mercenary is possessed by a demon (an entity later called [[Demogoblin]]). During the encounter, the demon infects Moon Knight with a demonic parasite.<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #33 (Marvel Comics, 1991).</ref> Unaware of the infection, Moon Knight continues his crime-fighting activities. He and the Punisher encounter the renegade branch of the Cult of Khonshu again and its new leader Sandal Swarn, a former CIA operative who now calls herself Princess Nepthys, a former CIA operative and the lover of Randall Spector. Using mind-control techniques she learned in the CIA, she was able to convince an impostor to assume Randall's identity as the Hatchet-Man and fight Moon Knight, leading to the man's death. Assuming a leadership role in the Cult of Khonshu following Plasma's death, Nepthys declares that Randall will be Khonshu's true knight of vengeance. Randall and Nepthys destroy Moon Knight's house in a bombing that leaves Frenchie paralyzed. Calling himself ShadowKnight, Randall undergoes experimental treatment by Nepthys that gives him superhuman resiliency to injury thanks to a shell over his skin. During their battle, Moon Knight sees an ancient scroll that seems to confirm Khonshu is dedicated to justice rather than vengeance. Moon Knight is able to crack ShadowKnight's shell with an adamantium weapon. Punisher executes Nepthys and later unleashes heavy gunfire on ShadowKnight, who suffers extensive internal injuries before then suffering a seemingly fatal fall.<ref name=":5" />

Following the destruction of his home, Marc Spector sets up a new "'''ShadowKeep'''" lair in the Lower West Side of Manhattan, nearby SpectorCorp headquarters. To advise him on his operations, his council "'''the Shadow Cabinet'''" meet at the ShadowKeep via holographic transmission and use codenames. The Shadow Cabinet includes tech expert Stash, business woman Penny Annie, low-level crime boss Don G, and psychologist Sigmund, who also acts as Marc's therapist.<ref name=":6" />

Soon afterward, the demonic parasite in his body causes Marc's strength to steadily increase even as his health and physical form deteriorate. To compensate for his health problems, he exchanges his kevlar Moon Knight armor for a new suit of light-weight [[adamantium]] armor right before he illegally enters the consulate of Latveria in order to confront the country's monarch [[Doctor Doom]].<ref name=":6">''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #38 (Marvel Comics, 1992).</ref> The Avengers, a team that relies on cooperation with the US government and the United Nations, learn Moon Knight gained help in invading the consulate by showing his credentials as an Avengers reservist and implying he was on an official mission. During the [[The Infinity War|''Infinity War'']] event, Moon Knight fights an alien-created doppleganger called Moon Shade who then absorbs the life force of different Moon Knights from parallel realities. This leads Moon Knight to meet a few of his multiversal counterparts, including the crime-fighting dynamic duo known as MoonMan and MoonBoy.<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #41-42 (Marvel Comics, 1992).</ref>

Following the Infinity War, [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Mister Fantastic]] operate on Moon Knight and remove the parasite.<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #46 (Marvel Comics, 1992).</ref> Moon Knight is warned it won't be certain until 48 hours have passed whether or not the damage done by the parasite is fatal. Marc Spector contemplates who could be the new Moon Knight if he dies. After deciding two candidates chosen by his "legacy quest" program are not suitable, Spector tries to recruit photojournalist Peter Parker, not realizing the young man is also Spider-Man. After Parker declines, Moon Knight gives up finding a successor. He is relieved when the 48 hour mark passes and his health remains stable. A side effect seems to be that his eyes now have a crescent-moon mark over the irises (though this mutation vanishes in later stories).<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #47 (Marvel Comics, 1992).</ref> Afterward, the Avengers confront Moon Knight about his abuse of his team reservist status to confront Doctor Doom. The hero decides to simply matters by resigning his membership and burning his Avengers ID card.<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #50. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A technological villain called Seth the Immortal and his "Zero Hour" program threaten Moon Knight and all his allies. During a desperate battle, Moon Knight defeats Seth by blowing up his office with both of them inside, sacrificing himself in the process. Marlene is present and holds him as he dies. He is buried by his friends on the grounds of the estate he purchased as Steven Grant.<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #60. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Moon Knight'' vol. 3 - "Resurrection Wars"; ''Moon Knight'' vol. 4 - "High Strangeness"===
When the god Set selects his own avatar to act on Earth and perform acts of destruction, Khonshu responds. Marc Spector wakes up in his grave and has a vision of being tasked with resuming his life as a champion of the moon. In the mansion of Steven Grant, Marlene and Frenchie witness a statue of Khonshu seemingly explode, revealing a living and fully healed Marc Spector. Marc's latest resurrection (his third) and the fact that the Khonshu statue magically returns, fully repaired, finally convinces Marlene that Moon Knight does not suffer delusions and is in fact the chosen avatar of the moon god.

For a time, Moon Knight decides to allow the world to continue believing Marc Spector is dead and chooses instead to focus on his other identities of Moon Knight, Steven Grant, and Jake Lockley. Despite this, news surfaces that Marc Spector is alive, leading to assassination attempts.

===''Moon Knight'' vol. 5 (2006–2009)===
For reasons unexplained, Moon Knight abandons his belief that his role includes understanding his enemies and offering redemption and now acts with greater violence and brutality. Defeating Bushman after a vicious battle, Moon Knight goes further by carving off the villain's face. Spector is then haunted by Khonshu, who chooses a faceless Bushman as his representation. Frenchie reveals he is [[homosexual]] or [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and that he has been so loyal to Marc in part because he is in love with him, though he knows these feelings are not felt in return.

The new Secret Committee hires [[Profile (comics)|the Profile]], who has superhuman analytical skills, to help trap Moon Knight. After the plan fails, Profile becomes a reluctant confidante and source of information for Spector himself. Around this time, some heroes take notice that Moon Knight is now more violent and ruthless and attempt to speak to him about it.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 5 #7-10 (Marvel Comics).</ref> Moon Knight discovers his would-be sidekick Midnight may still be alive. Moon Knight is later forced into a final confrontation Midnight. No longer attempting reconciliation, Moon Knight seemingly kills him for good.<ref name="auto">''Moon Knight'' vol. 5 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The new [[Superhero Registration Act]], enforced by registered heroes such as [[Iron Man]], requires superhumans and costumed champions to register as agents of the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. or be imprisoned, After prodding from Khonshu, Moon Knight reluctantly registers, not wanting authorities to interfere with his agenda. To be approved for registration requires a psychiatric exam. Believing Moon Knight to be mentally unstable and thinking he could become worse if he finds himself in conflict with the Registration Act or its enforcement, Tony Stark and the government have no intention of granting Marc Spector approval. The psychiatrist agrees and is about to make the decision official, even suggesting possible future imprisonment. Spector then seems to speak in the voice of Khonshu and points out the doctor's own antisocial tendencies (as told to Moon Knight earlier by the Profile). The psychiatrist gives Moon Knight a pass on his exam and literally bows in deference to Khonshu.<ref name="auto1" />

Moon Knight shows little regard for his newly licensed superhero status or his registered colleagues. Moon Knight's old enemy Carson Knowles, the Black Spectre, steals Stark Tech nanotechnology and attempts to frame him for murder before attacking the city. Moon Knight confronts Knowles and pushes him off a rooftop, apparently causing a fatal fall. Iron Man revokes Moon Knight's superhero registration and buries the fact that Black Spectre stole his technology.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 5 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> Rather than be imprisoned, Moon Knight becomes a fugitive and is hunted by the Registration Act's new enforcers, the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Marc Spector gives up his role as Moon Knight so he can fight crime clandestinely while wearing an entirely black costume. He considers that crimefighting is easier without "costume recognition" and the resulting reputation but later reconsiders, believing he no longer has the insight and protection of Khonshu.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 5 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later pleads for Khonshu's forgiveness for turning his back on him. Khonshu then appears and says he has other worshippers now and no longer needs Marc Spector.

When the [[Whyos]] gang attacks Frenchie's restaurant and injures his lover Rob, Spector becomes Moon Knight again to avenge his friend. He learns it's a trap, an attack designed to draw him into another conflict with the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 5 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref> Moon Knight is captured but then escapes. Frenchie agrees to help Spector while the villain [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] is released from prison in order to kill Moon Knight.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 5 #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Moon Knight and Bullseye engage in battle. Moon Knight lures the assassin into a trap, a warehouse wired to explode. Bullseye escapes and it is believed Moon Knight himself dies in the explosion, leading Iron Man to denounce the methods used by the Thunderbolts. In truth, Moon Knight used the trap to fake his own death, and relocates to Mexico. His Jake Lockley personality resurfaces and becomes the dominant alter.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 5 #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> After hiding for a time, Lockley crosses paths with local Mexican criminal cartels and encounters the Punisher again, as well as an avatar of [[Toltec]].<ref name="Moon Knight #30">''Moon Knight'' vol. 5 #30.

In the U.S., the organization S.H.I.E.L.D. is shut down and replaced by H.A.M.M.E.R., now led by Norman Osborn, the villain who led the Thunderbolts against Moon Knight. Concerned about Osborn having such a position of power and now being in charge of enforcing and controlling registered superheroes, Moon Knight decides to return.<ref name="Moon Knight #30" />

===''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' (2009–2010)===
Returning to New York, Moon Knight now struggles against his recently violent nature and determines to once again be more heroic, never to kill his enemies or cause them more injury than necessary.

Moon Knight's efficient crimefighting and his non-lethal tactics quickly gain favor with New York's population, angering Norman Osborn.<ref>''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Osborn later hires the villains the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] and [[Profile (comics)|Profile]] to take down Moon Knight. The Hood uses the powers of the demon sorcerer[[Dormammu]] to bring Bushman back to life.<ref>''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Bushman and the villain [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]]  Bushman break into Ravencroft Asylum and recruits soldiers by lobotomizing several patients and manipulating them to attack New York. Moon Knight defeats them and subdues Bushman. Khonshu screams for lethal vengeance to be delivered, but Moon Knight defies him and spares Bushman's life.

Deciding he needs to manage his mental health better, Marc Spector meets with a psychologist who determines that he does not have dissociative identity disorder (DID) as some have hypothesized in the past or some form of schizophrenia. In truth, he has a form of brain damage due to his brain being physically altered by Khonshu, who is a real entity from another world or dimension and altered Marc in order to create a conduit between them. Marc's different personalities are a result of his mind adjusting to the four different aspects of Khonshu's nature and aspects. It is why he sometimes has four alters existing simultaneously but never more. Moon Knight encounters another renegade Cult of Khonshu, though this cell targets the homeless and other marginalized people, making them new cult members as well or using them as human sacrifices.

Khonshu contacts Marc and explains that Emmet is an avatar like him, one who is connected to the Othervoid god Ammit. Khonshu decides it is now time for him to completely dominate Marc Spector's body. Marc denies Khonshu and fights him with the help of all of his alters. Marc accepts that whether they are the result of childhood trauma or Khonshu's interference, his alters are a part of him and have been for most of his life. After defeating Emmet and Khonshu, Marc resumes his life as Moon Knight, determined to be a protector and crime-fighter on his own terms rather than as a tool of anyone else. Later, Marc and Khonshu resume their bond.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 8 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Moon Knight'' vol. 9 (2018)===
After re-appropriating Khonshu, Marc Spector resumes his normal life and his Moon Knight activities. Raoul Bushman collaborates with a mysterious mental patient only referred to as "Patient 86", who becomes an avatar of [[Amun|Ra]] and calling himself the Sun King. Together they come up with a plot to kill Moon Knight.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #189. Marvel Comics.</ref> To accomplish their plan, Bushman and Sun King go to Marlene's house and discovered she and Jack Lockley had a child together, a revelation that shocks Marc Spector and Steve Grant.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #190. Marvel Comics.</ref> Raoul and Sun King then kidnap Marlene and lure Moon Knight to an island base. With Khonshu's guidance, Moon Knight is able to overpower Sun King, although Bushman escapes.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #191–193. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== "The Age of Khonshu" ===
Deciding to take over Earth in order to protect it, Khonshu compels Moon Knight to acquire power for him. With enhanced abilities and insight, and convinced that Khonshu's plan is the only way to protect Earth from the demon lord [[Mephisto (Marvel Comics)|Mephisto]] and others, Moon Knight takes the power of [[Iron Fist (character)|Iron Fist]], Ghost Rider's hellfire, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s hammer Mjolnir, and some of Dr. Strange's magic. With this and more, Khonshu begins to reshape Earth. During a battle with the Black Panther, Moon Knight temporarily becomes a host for the cosmic Phoenix Force. But rather than allow the Phoenix power to "cleanse" the Earth by wiping out humanity, Moon Knight releases the power even while the Avengers defeat Khonshu. The Asgardians imprison Khonshu and Moon Knight is allowed to return to his activities. The Black Panther offers him membership in the Avengers again, but he refuses, preferring to focus on battles he understands and angry at Khonshu's extreme actions.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #33-38 (Marvel Comics, 2020).</ref>

=== ''Moon Knight'' vol. 10 (2021) ===
Despite believing that Khonshu is a god unworthy of his worship, Marc Spector still considers them both connected and decides to continue acting not only as a knight of the moon god but a priest of his teachings. He creates the Midnight Mission, a religious congregation following the teachings of Khonshu. As its high priest, Marc adopts his Mr. Knight suit and mask as his official religious vestments. Living at the Midnight Mission, he offers aid to listen to anyone who visits and needs his help. As Moon Knight, Marc frees several people who were kidnapped by vampires and unwillingly made into vampires themselves. Rather than condemn them, he offers them sympathy. One of the new vampires, a woman named Reese, takes a job as Marc's assistant at the Midnight Mission.

==Comparisons to Batman==
[[Charlie Huston]], writer of the 2006 re-launch of ''Moon Knight'', attempted to answer the criticism that Moon Knight is an [[Ersatz good|ersatz]] [[Batman]] in an interview with Comixfan.<ref>[http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=35259 "Charlie Huston: Shining Light on Moon Knight"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192520/http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=35259 |date=2007-09-27 }}, ''Comixfan'', August 17, 2005</ref> The interviewer noted that the comparison is not baseless, as both Moon Knight and the Dark Knight are wealthy, "normal" humans who fight crime with detective skills, cover identities, skilled confidants, and are equipped with high-tech gadgetry, personalized air craft, and personalized throwing items. Likewise, Moon Knight briefly had a teenage would-be sidekick.

Huston accepted the two characters have similarities, but went on to contrast them by noting in particular differences in origin, motives, and personality. He said, "Bruce Wayne fights crime to avenge the murders of his parents," whereas Moon Knight "beats up whoever has it coming because he believes he is the avatar of the Egyptian god of vengeance and it helps him to feel better about all the people he killed when he was a mercenary." Thus, Batman is motivated by vengeance for a personal wrong against his parents, while Marc Spector is motivated by vengeance as a concept. Huston further notes that Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, takes on other identities merely to aid in his investigations, while Moon Knight's three alter egos aid him as much in dealing with personal demons as fighting law-breakers, and had a further psychological toll by apparently causing [[dissociative identity disorder]]. Over the years, many readers pointed out the unrealistic nature of a person acquiring DID or schizophrenia simply by using cover identities, and later comics clarified that this is not the case and Marc Spector's personalities are symptomatic of his psychic connection to the moon god Khonshu's different aspects and the brain damage resulting from this connection.<ref>"[http://www.comicvine.com/moon-knight-7-midnight-sun-chapter-1-the-woodwork/4000-106012/ Moon Knight #7 – Midnight Sun, Chapter 1: The Woodwork]", Marvel, January 1st, 2007, p.6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
===Skills and training===
Moon Knight is an Olympic-level athlete and a skilled acrobat who excels at combat strategy. Spector is a superb driver and can pilot a helicopter. Thanks to his life training and experience as a [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]], boxer, and mercenary, Marc Spector became an expert at hand-to-hand combat, guns, [[boxing]],<ref>''Moon Knight'' #37 (May 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]], [[Arnis|eskrima]], [[judo]],<ref>''Moon Knight'' #26 (December 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> [[karate]], [[ninjutsu]], [[savate]],<ref>''Werewolf by Night'' #32 (August 1975). Marvel Comics.</ref> and [[Muay Thai]]. Moon Knight's fighting style combines elements of various combat techniques and relies heavily on adaptability, using the environment to his advantage, intimidating his opponents, and accepting a certain level of pain and injury. The villain and mercenary [[Taskmaster (character)|Taskmaster]], who can perfectly replicate fighting styles, has stated he prefers not to copy Moon Knight since the hero would sometimes rather take a punch than block or dodge it.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 3 #5 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> Moon Knight is shown to possess a very high tolerance for pain and torture.<ref>"[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/moon-knight-6-the-bottom-chapter-6-glories-such-as/4000-106135/ Moon Knight #6 – The Bottom, Chapter 6: Glories Such As These]", Marvel, November 1st, 2006</ref>

===Technology and equipment===
As Moon Knight, Spector typically wears lightweight kevlar body armor and a specially constructed, silver glider cape that can catch winds and thermal updrafts. He typically wears metal bracers on his wrists and calves. Later costumes have added metal plates providing extra protection to his chest and shoulders. Moon Knight employs a variety of weapons over the course of his career, many of which involve or are made of silver. His most commonly used weapons are his silver crescent-dart (some of which are blunt, some of which are blades) and an adamantium reinforced [[Club (weapon)|truncheon]] that can fire a grappling hook and extend into a [[bō]] staff. At times, he has also used [[nunchaku]] and a compound bow. For a brief time, Moon Knight wore gauntlets with spiked knuckles.<ref>''Vengeance of Moon Knight'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

For a time, Moon Knight accepted golden and ivory Egyptian-themed weapons created by followers of Khonshu.<ref>"[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/moon-knight-fist-of-khonshu-1-night-of-the-jackal/4000-25586/ Moon Knight: Fist of Khonshu #1 – Night of the Jackal"], Marvel, June 1, 1985</ref> These included [[bolas]], golden scarab-shaped darts, an ivory boomerang, throwing irons, an axe-shaped lasso-grapple, and a golden [[ankh]]-shaped blunt weapon which glowed in the presence of danger. These items were later replaced with duplicate weapons designed by [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].

For a time while suffering from health issues, Moon Knight adopts thin, lightweight [[adamantium]] armor for greater protection. During this time, he acquires an adamantium staff, a truncheon capable of firing a cable line, and gauntlets that fire crescent darts.<ref>"[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/marc-spector-moon-knight-38-blood-brothers-part-fo/4000-35679/ Marc Spector: Moon Knight #38 – Blood Brothers, Part Four: The Avatar of Khonshu"], Marvel, May 1, 1992</ref>

During the events of "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]," the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]] makes Moon Knight [[Adamantium|carbonadium]] armor with joint-locking functions, reinforcing his strength.<ref name="Vengeance5">''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Moon Knight uses this feature to support a building from collapsing, despite a lack of superhuman strength. Additionally, the armor could instantly assembled around his body after being triggered by remote control.<ref name="Vengeance5" />

For transportation, Moon Knight employs a variety of sophisticated aircraft such as the [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Moon Knight's Helicopter|Mooncopter]] and the Angelwing, a mini-jet featuring VTOL ((vertical take-off and landing) and 20mm cannons. At times, Moon Knight has also used a white customized motorcycle, a remote-controlled white limousine, and a remote-controlled crescent-shaped drone/glider capable of carrying a single person.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 7 #1–2 (Marvel Comics, 2016).</ref>

===Superpowers===
On more than one occasion, Marc Spector has seemingly died and then been resurrected by the other-dimensional entity Khonshu. It is not known if Khonshu will continually do this, making Marc Spector effectively immortal, or if he will only do this until he choses a new champion.

Due to his brain being altered by Khonshu, Marc Spector is more resistant to telepathic and psychic attack than the average person. He sometimes experiences visions of prophecy or enhanced insight. Some initially believed these visions were delusions or inspired simply by Spector inadvertently performing self-hypnosis, but it is now known that Khonshu is real and grants him these visions. It has been implied in several stories that Marc's connection to Khonshu and this supernatural insight increases when he wears his Moon Knight costume, as it represents "vestments" of the moon god. The villain-for-hire [[Profile (comics)|Profile]] has a superhuman analysis ability that does not function properly on beings with supernatural/magic-based abilities, and remarked that he found it painful to look at Marc Spector whenever the hero donned his Moon Knight costume. Profile wasn't sure if this was due to Spector's mental illness or if wearing the costume helped Moon Knight tap directly into the moon god's power.<ref>"[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/moon-knight-12-midnight-sun-chapter-six-this-trap-/4000-114432/ Moon Knight #12 – Midnight Sun, Chapter 6: This Trap, My Body]", Marvel, November 1st, 2007</ref>

During the time that Moon Knight adopted golden and ivory weapons (symbolizing his status as the First of Khonshu), his strength, endurance, and reflexes would increase depending on the phases of the moon, operating on a superhuman level during a full moon night. Even during a new moon, he can lift several hundred pounds.<ref name="Marvel Spotlight #28" /> Although some believed this superhuman strength had nothing to do with Khonshu and was the result of self-hypnosis, it is now known that Khonshu is real and is directly connected to Marc Spector. Khonshu later removed this power from Moon Knight, as punishment for disobedience, and has never returned it.<ref name=":1" />

Marvel Comics.</ref> As part of this group, Spector adopts the Ronin identity to infiltrate the Kingpin's ranks. The idea of turning 'Ronin' into the main persona is made by the Grant and Spector personalities who oppose the Moon Knight persona and the small girl persona's concerns. In doing so, they create a far more ruthless personality who the Kingpin would find suitable. Moon Knight himself is angered by this decision, but is seemingly destroyed by the Ronin personality.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #108. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Kingpin discovers that Ronin is working for Daredevil and orders his execution.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #109. Marvel Comics.</ref> He survives, however, and after regaining consciousness goes to the police claiming that the Kingpin ordered his execution.
