==Fictional character biography==
In the alternate reality of Earth-TRN666, where [[Thanos]] conquered all the Universe, Frank Castle's early life was seemingly similar to that of the Frank Castle of the Earth-616 Universe. However, when Thanos came to Earth, the Punisher was one of the last casualties during the last stand of the heroes and his soul was subsequently sent to Hell. Willing to give anything in order to punish Thanos for slaughtering his planet, the Punisher signed a demonic deal with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and became the [[Ghost Rider]]. When he returned to Earth, however, Thanos was already gone and everything on the planet was dead. Roaming endlessly and undying with no one to kill or love, the Ghost Rider spent the next countless years alone. He eventually began to lose his mind when even Mephisto fell silent to his calls. When a badly injured [[Galactus]] arrived on Earth seeking help against Thanos, unaware that the population of Earth had already been killed by him, the Ghost Rider offered the dead planet to him in exchange for the chance of punishing the Mad Titan as his herald which the Great Devourer accepted. Bestowed with the Power Cosmic, Ghost Rider became Cosmic Ghost Rider.<ref>''Thanos'' Vol. 2 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Alongside Galactus, Cosmic Ghost Rider traveled across the cosmos on a quest to halt Thanos' systematic annihilation of every living being in existence, which led them to become legends. Their story lasted centuries, but came to an end once they finally confronted Thanos, who beheaded Galactus as he approached to battle. The undying Rider was offered by Thanos the chance to see more evil than he could punish in a thousand lifetimes, and thus became his servant.<ref name="Thanos #16">''Thanos'' Vol. 2 #16.

[[Odin (comics)|Odin]] from the main reality retrieved Cosmic Ghost Rider's soul from the dead reality and rewarded him with Valhalla. Though Cosmic Ghost Rider wasn't satisfied. Odin returned his powers and offered to revive him in any time period of his choosing. Cosmic Ghost Rider chose the day Thanos was born. Being revived in that year, Cosmic Ghost Rider confronted the baby Thanos where his Penance Stare hasn't detected any sins yet. Cosmic Ghost Rider then takes Baby Thanos under his wing in order to change his future so that he won't be evil.<ref>''Cosmic Ghost Rider'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Tracking down Galactus to the planet Markus-Centauri which he plans to devour, the Cosmic Ghost Rider tried to get Galactus to help him to no avail after Galactus scanned his memories. With [[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] bearing witness, an angry Cosmic Ghost Rider vowed to raise Thanos on his own consequently.<ref>''Cosmic Ghost Rider'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> By doing that, Cosmic Ghost Rider created a new timeline where Thanos grew up to become something worse and the Guardians of the Galaxy of said timeline tried to change their future by killing Thanos. Unfortunately, Frank and later on baby Thanos killed them all. They were subsequently greeted by Thanos' future self, who sported the same clothes Cosmic Ghost Rider used as the Punisher.<ref>''Cosmic Ghost Rider'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Thanos from the future brings Rider and his infant self to his world where he stopped all of the Wars in the universe and saved Frank's family. The Rider was happy at first, until he found out that Thanos was as dictator to the planets he invaded. Frank horrified of what Thanos turned into, he kills him and back in time to leave baby Thanos where he got him and accepting the monster Thanos will become.<ref>''Cosmic Ghost Rider'' #4-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the aftermath of the "[[Infinity Wars]]" storyline, Cosmic Ghost Rider is revealed to be stranded on Earth Prime and was present at Thanos' funeral. [[Starfox (comics)|Eros]] shows all the guests a recording of Thanos stating that he uploaded his consciousness in a new body before his death. The funeral is attacked by the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], who steals Thanos's body and rip open a hole in space, sending everyone into the rip. Though Cosmic Ghost Rider got to safety with [[Star-Lord]], [[Groot]], [[Beta Ray Bill]], [[Phyla-Vell]], and [[Moondragon]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 5 #1.
