The '''Vision''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Since his conception, the character has been adapted into several forms of media outside comics. [[Paul Bettany]] portrays [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016) and ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and the [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]'' (2021).

== Publication history ==
Writer [[Roy Thomas]] decided to add a new team member to the superhero-team series ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]''. Thomas wanted to bring back the Golden Age [[Vision (Aarkus)]] but Stan Lee was set on introducing an android member. Thomas ultimately compromised by using a new, android Vision.<ref name="back45">{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= December 2010|title= Shattered Dreams: Vision and the Scarlet Witch|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45|pages= 59–65| publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> The second Vision [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''The Avengers'' #57 (Oct. 1968). Thomas wanted the character to be white as befitting his ghostly name, but printing limitations of the time would have rendered him colorless, with un-inked paper where his skin should be. He settled on red as he did not want Vision to be green like the [[Hulk]] or blue like the [[Homo mermanus|Atlanteans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/age-ultron-creator-roy-thomas-791320|title=Marvel Legend Reveals What Stan Lee Initially "Hated" About 'Age of Ultron' Breakout}}</ref> The character has been compared with [[Spock]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'', but Thomas said that he was barely aware of the TV series at the time.<ref name="oral">{{cite web |url= https://www.yahoo.com/movies/the-secret-origins-of-vision-and-ultron-an-oral-118171812977.html|title= The Secret Origins of Vision and Ultron: An Oral History|author=Marcus Errico|date= May 6, 2015|publisher= Yahoo|access-date=May 26, 2015}}</ref> He acknowledged being influenced by the [[Adam Link]] character by [[Otto Binder]], one of the first robots treated as a sympathetic character rather than as a mechanical tool.<ref name="oral" />

In ''The Avengers'' #75 (April 1970), the [[Scarlet Witch]] is reintroduced to the team and soon becomes a love interest for Vision. Thomas recounted, "I felt that a romance of some sort would help the character development in ''The Avengers'', and the Vision was a prime candidate because he appeared only in that mag... as did Wanda, for that matter. So they became a pair, for just such practical considerations. It would also, I felt, add to the development I was doing on the Vision's attempting to become ‘human.’"<ref name="back45" /> Thomas also came up with the idea of the Vision having been created from the body of the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], but only planted a vague clue to this (in ''The Avengers'' #93) before leaving the series. It was finally followed up in ''The Avengers'' #134–135. Writer [[Steve Englehart]] explained, "That plot was well known in-house for years, and since Roy [Thomas] and [[Neal Adams|Neal [Adams]]] hadn't had a chance to do it, I did it on my watch with Roy's blessing."<ref name="Back38">{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= February 2010|title= Ultron: The Black Sheep of the Avengers Family|journal= Back Issue!|issue= 38|page= 25|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing}}</ref>

In 1972 Vision appeared with [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #5, "A Passion of the Mind", in which a giant robot scout from [[the Kree-Skrull War]] is found to be interfering with Vision's brain waves.

Vision and Scarlet Witch were married in ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (June 1975). The couple starred in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[The Vision and the Scarlet Witch]]'' #1–4 (Nov. 1982 – Feb. 1983), by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[penciller]] [[Rick Leonardi]]. This was followed by a second volume numbered #1–12 (Oct. 1985 – Sept. 1986), written by Steve Englehart and penciled by [[Richard Howell (comics)|Richard Howell]], in which the Scarlet Witch gives birth to twin boys conceived with Vision through magical means.

The "Vision Quest" story in ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' #42–45 (March – June 1989) by writer/penciller [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] took the character away from his earlier depictions as a "synthetic human" and emphasized his android nature. The story had the Vision's memory and human brain patterns wiped out, severed his relationship with his wife, revealed their children to be essentially imaginary constructs, and included a two-page spread showing a dismantled Vision. Journalist Karen Walker later commented, "This image alone has probably done more to shape how future writers (and readers) perceive the character than anything before or since. Once seen broken down into component parts, it's hard to truly move past that image and think of Vision as a synthetic man, not a machine."<ref name="back45" />

Vision appeared in a solo limited series, ''Vision'', #1–4 (Nov. 1994 – Feb. 1995), by writer [[Bob Harras]] and penciller Manny Clark. Nearly a decade after that came a second four-issue volume (Oct. 2002 – Jan. 2003), written by [[Geoff Johns]] and penciled by [[Ivan Reis]].

The series ''[[Young Avengers]]'', which ran 12 issues from April 2005 to August 2006, introduced [[Vision (Jonas)|a new Vision]], who is a combination of the synthezoid Vision's program files and the armor and mental engrams of the hero [[Iron Lad]].

Vision appeared as a regular character in the 2010–2013 ''Avengers'' series, from issue #19 (January 2012) through its final issue #34 (January 2013).

Vision again appeared in a solo series, ''Vision'', with #1 that started in November 2015 and ended with #12 in October 2016.

The robot [[Ultron]] is the creator of Vision, a type of [[Android (robot)|android]] he calls a "synthezoid", for use against Ultron's own creator, Dr. [[Hank Pym]] (Ant-Man/Giant Man/Goliath/Yellowjacket) and Pym's wife, Janet van Dyne (the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]) of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Ultron sends his new servant to lead the Avengers into a trap. Wasp is the first to encounter the synthezoid, and describes it as a "vision" while trying to escape. Adopting the name, Vision is convinced by the Avengers to turn against Ultron.<ref>''Avengers'' #57 (Oct. 1968). Marvel Comics.</ref> After learning how Ultron created him, using the brain patterns of then-deceased Simon Williams ([[Wonder Man]]), Vision becomes a member of the team.<ref>''Avengers'' #58. Marvel Comics.</ref> The team initially believes the Vision's body was created from that of the android [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]].<ref>Hinted at in ''The Avengers'' #116 & 118 (Oct. & Dec. 1973). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Avengers later are told that the time lord [[Immortus]] used the power of the Forever Crystal to split the original Human Torch into two entities – one body remained the original Torch while Ultron rebuilt the other as the Vision. This was part of his plan to nurture a relationship for the Scarlet Witch that would prevent her from having any children, as her power level meant that any offspring she might have could threaten the cosmic beings of the Marvel Universe.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #8 (July 1999). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Not long after joining the team, Vision is temporarily controlled by Ultron, and rebuilds Ultron out of adamantium, battling the Avengers before regaining control of himself.<ref>''Avengers'' #66–68. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shortly after that, the Vision first meets Wanda Maximoff, the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Scarlet Witch]],<ref>''Avengers'' #76. Marvel Comics.</ref> with whom he later becomes romantically involved.<ref>''Avengers'' #108–109. Marvel Comics.</ref> The two eventually marry and, via the Scarlet Witch's hex powers, they have twin boys named Thomas and William.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2, #3 & 12 (Dec. 1985 & Sept. 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Vision attempts to penetrate an energy field erected by the villain [[Annihilus]], he "shuts down",<ref>''The Avengers'' #233 (July 1983). Marvel Comics.</ref> and even after regaining consciousness weeks later,<ref>''Avengers'' #238 (Nov. 1983). Marvel Comics.</ref> remains paralyzed and assumes a [[Holography|holographic]] form. He eventually regains control of his body and becomes team leader.<ref>''Avengers'' #242–243 (April – May 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref> Having become unbalanced by these events, he attempts to take control of the world's computers.<ref>''Avengers'' #251 (Jan. 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> With the aid of the Avengers, Vision is restored to his normal self, but now closely monitored by a coalition of governments.<ref>''Avengers'' #253–254 (March–April 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the "Vision Quest" storyline, rogue agents of the [[United States]] government, manipulated by the [[time travel]]er [[Immortus]], abduct the Vision and dismantle him. The Avengers recover the parts, and Dr. Pym rebuilds Vision, but with a chalk-white complexion. However, the revived Simon Williams does not allow his brain patterns to be used again to provide a matrix for Vision's emotions, explaining that the original process, done without his consent, had "ripped out his soul". This, along with damage to Vision's synthetic skin when he was dismantled, results in the synthezoid's resurrection as a colorless and emotionless [[Android (robot)|artificial human]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #42–44 (March–May 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]] also returns from his own apparent demise, casting doubt on Vision's identity. Vision and the Scarlet Witch's children are then revealed to be fragments of the soul of the [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who had been broken apart by [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] shortly before the birth of the twins. The twins are absorbed back into Mephisto, which temporarily drives Wanda insane. Although she recovers, Wanda and Vision separate, each operating on a different Avengers team.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #51–52 (Nov.-Dec. 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Vision gradually regains his emotions, by adopting new brain patterns from deceased scientist Alex Lipton,<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'', #40 (Jan. 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> and gains a new body that resembles his original. In addition, Simon Williams' brain patterns gradually reemerge and meld with Lipton's patterns, restoring Vision's full capacity for emotion.<ref>''Vision'', #1–4 (Nov. 1994 – Feb. 1995), Marvel Comics.</ref>

Shortly after a reformation of the Avengers, Vision sustains massive damage in the final battle with the sorceress [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fey]],<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #4 (May 1998). Marvel Comics.</ref> and although incapacitated for several weeks, is eventually rebuilt and recovers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #12 (Jan. 1999). Marvel Comics.</ref> While recovering, Vision gives up his attempt to reconcile with his wife,{{issue|date=July 2020}} although he is revealed to retain a fondness for her culture, such as visiting a restaurant that specifically caters to Wanda's childhood community simply because he enjoys the ambiance.{{issue|date=July 2020}} Remaining a member of the Avengers, he briefly becomes romantically involved with teammates [[Ms. Marvel|Carol Danvers]] (a.k.a.

=== ''Disassembled'' / ''Reassembled'' ===
Grief over the loss of the twins, however, drives Wanda insane again, and she attempts to alter reality to recreate them. This causes a series of catastrophic events that includes Vision crashing an Avengers [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Quinjet|Quinjet]] into [[Avengers Mansion]]. The Vision advises his teammates that he is no longer in control of his body, and then expels several spheres that form into five Ultrons. The Avengers destroy them, and an enraged [[She-Hulk]] tears apart the remains of the Vision, having been driven to a breaking point by the rapid slew of attacks against the Avengers. The Avengers later believed that [[Ultron]] may have put a command in the Vision that would have been activated by the Avengers' Code White alert during one of the many periods in which Vision was held prisoner by Ultron, though it was later revealed that Dr. Doom forced Scarlet Witch to send Vision against her teammates.<ref name="avengersdisassembled">''The Avengers'' #500 (Sept. 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>name="avengersthechildren'scrusade">''Avengers The Children's Crusade''(2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Vision's operating system and program files are later used in the creation of Iron Lad's armor, which becomes [[Vision (Jonas)|a sentient being of its own]]. In ''Mighty Avengers'' the original Vision and Iron Lad are briefly separated from this being by the power of the Cosmic Cube.<ref>'' The Mighty Avengers'' #33 (Jan. 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]" story line, Vision is one of many deceased heroes restored to life after the events in the death realms.<ref>''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Vision joins with the other resurrected Avengers in their fight against Grim Reaper and Nekra.<ref>''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the fight, Vision blows himself up while in battle with Grim Reaper, killing them both.<ref>''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" story line, Tony Stark is able to rebuild Vision, who once again joins the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 4 #19 (Jan. 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref> After being informed about what happened after his destruction, the Vision sees She-Hulk, telling her he does not blame her for what happened. He then goes to Utopia to confront [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], threatening Magneto to tell him where Wanda is. Magneto uses his powers to subdue the Vision but spares him, saying he believes Wanda still cares for the Vision and that Magneto does not want to hurt her more. Captain America talks to the Vision afterward, telling him he needs to move forward.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 4 #24.1 (May 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During a subsequent confrontation with the returned Wanda at the start of the "[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]" story line, Vision claims that her use of his body to attack his friends is something that he cannot forgive and, while he banishes her from the mansion, he also sheds tears after her departure.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #0 (May 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' relaunch, Vision leaves the Avengers in order to find himself following a battle with [[Sunturion]]. After departing the team, he is shown visiting [[Wiccan (comics)|Billy Kaplan]], the teenage reincarnation of one of his sons.<ref>''Avengers Assemble Annual'' #1 (February 2013). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the "[[Age of Ultron]]" storyline, Vision joins Hank Pym's [[Avengers A.I.]] alongside [[Monica Chang]], [[Victor Mancha]], and a reprogrammed [[Doombot]].<ref>''Avengers A.I.'' #1, Marvel Comics.</ref> He also upgraded himself and is now actually composed of millions of microrobotic automatons or nanobots.<ref name="Avengers A.I. #1">''Avengers A.I.'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the miniseries ''Ultron Forever'', Vision and Black Widow of the present are drawn into the future by what appears to be Doctor Doom to join a team of Avengers from various points in the team's history, including an early Hulk, James Rhodes as Iron Man, Thor when he was afflicted by the curse of Hela, the female Thor of the present, and Danielle Cage from a future where she wields Captain America's shield. 'Doom' claims that he brought this team together to assist him in defeating Ultron's conquest of the world.<ref>''Avengers: Ultron Forever'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although Doom's true plan is revealed at the story's conclusion to be a desire to take Ultron's place, Vision eventually reveals that this Doom is actually the Doombot who worked with him in the Avengers A.I., convincing the Doombot to abandon his plan by noting that simply following Doom's example ignores the more positive aspects of Doom's history as the man who refused to let anyone else dictate his terms.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers: Ultron Forever'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]], Vision is a member of a new team of Avengers,<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> although his emotional data has been lost once again after a series of hallucinations forced him to delete the emotional data to restore himself to a functional state, having been overwhelmed with guilt when he was unable to save the sole survivor of a crashed bus.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, after he provides fake evidence to force new heroes Nova and Ms. Marvel to leave the team, it is revealed that he is working for [[Kang the Conqueror]] as Kang mounts his latest assault on the team,<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> having been contaminated when Kang interfered with his recent reprogramming. However, Vision is released from Kang's control when Iron Man manages to purge his software, allowing him to turn on Kang and help the Avengers defeat him, although in the aftermath he departs to consider how easily he fell under Kang's control.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== ''The Visions'' ===
In 2016, Vision was given a solo series. In the series, he lives in [[Fairfax, Virginia]] with a newly-created synthezoid family: his wife Virginia, son Vin, and daughter [[Viv Vision]]. They attempt to live a normal [[suburb]]an life with Vision working as a consultant to the president, but they find socializing with neighbors difficult. The [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] attacks their house and nearly kills Viv.<ref>''Vision'' Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Virginia claims that the Reaper escaped, but Vision eventually finds his remains buried in the backyard. He lies to the police and covers for Virginia when asked about her whereabouts during the murder of one of Viv's classmates, whose father tried to blackmail Virginia for the murder.<ref>''Vision'' Vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Instead of confronting her, he creates a synthezoid dog for the family in an attempt to return to normalcy. Unbeknownst to him, [[Agatha Harkness]] has a vision of the future and warns the Avengers that Vision and his family will cause a genocide.<ref>''The Vision'' Vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Avengers sent [[Victor Mancha]], Vision's "brother", to secretly investigate the family. When Vin discovers Victor reporting back to the Avengers, the latter attempts to use his electro-magnetic powers to contain Vin and prevent him from outing his operations, but a miscalculation caused him to damage Vin's nerve systems beyond repair.<ref>''Vision'' Vol 2 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Vision sets out to Arlington Courthouse Jail to exact revenge on Victor. Virginia reveals to Viv that she had murdered her classmate. Viv's resulting emotional outburst prompts Virginia to let out her anger on Sparky, killing it. Among the dog's remains, Virginia notices a petal of the Wundagore Everbloom that it had consumed, a plant capable of giving a person a vision of the future under certain parameters. With Sparky's death having fulfilled the conditions for the Everbloom to work, Virginia eats the petal. Seeing that Vision would go down a dark path if he killed Victor Mancha, she flies to the jail and murders Victor herself.<ref>''Vision'' Vol. 2 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Fearing the fate of Viv if both of her parents were to be prosecuted for their actions, Virginia calls the detective investigating their neighbours' disappearance and claims full responsibility for both her and her husband's crimes, stating she had tampered with Vision's operative system. Virginia proceeds to drink water with corrosive properties from a [[Zenn-Lavian]] water vase they have in their home and asks Vision to sit with her until the water kills her.<ref>''Vision'' Vol. 2 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" story line, Vision appears as a member of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]'s Avengers at the time Hydra took over the United States and when Captain America believed himself to be a Hydra sleeper agent.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ultron/Hank Pym reveals during his "dinner" with members of the Underground, Captain America, and Hydra's Avengers that Vision has been affected by an A.I. virus.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> While briefing Captain America about the status of Hydra's Avengers, [[Madame Hydra]] mentions the virus was created by [[Arnim Zola]], as well as stating that Vision is trying to fight its control.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the battle in Washington DC, Vision sees his freed daughter Viv. Seeing her enables him to free himself of the virus, which spreads to the Hydra Dreadnoughts and shuts them down.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, Vision and [[Doctor Nemesis]] met up with Luke Cage in Central Park where the [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] have infested it with their plants. As Vision starts to phase through them while scouting, he is attacked by a plant-like figure that grabs him with a special vine.<ref>''Empyre: Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Vision brings the fight outside of Central Park, Luke Cage and Doctor Nemesis mistake it for a Cotati only for Vision to correct them by stating that his opponent is actually [[Plantman]].<ref>''Empyre: Avengers'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Doctor Nemesis, Luke Cage, and Vision continue their fight with Plantman and his Sprout Soldiers. They managed to defeat Plantman, but are unable to make contact with Black Panther.<ref>''Empyre: Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Vision is described as being "every inch a human being—except that all of his bodily organs are constructed of synthetic materials."<ref>''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #57 (Oct. 1968). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Solar Jewel on Vision's forehead absorbs ambient [[solar energy]] to provide the power needed for him to function, and he is also capable of discharging this energy as optic beams; with this, he can fire beams of [[Infrared radiation|infrared]] and [[microwave radiation]]. In extreme cases he can discharge this same power through the Solar Jewel itself which amplifies its destructive effects considerably, albeit at the cost of losing most of his resources. By interfacing with an unknown dimension to which he can shunt and from which he can accrue mass, thus becoming either intangible or extraordinarily massive, Vision can change his [[density]], which at its lowest allows flight and a ghostly, phasing intangibility, and at its heaviest, a density ten times greater than that of [[depleted uranium]],<ref>''Avengers'' #332. Marvel Comics.</ref> which gives him superhuman strength, immovability, and a diamond-hard near invulnerability. On one occasion, Vision uses this extreme density to render unconscious the villain [[Count Nefaria]];<ref>''Avengers'' #166 (Dec. 1977). Marvel Comics.</ref> at other times, he thrusts an intangible hand into them and then partially re-materializes it, a process he describes as "physical disruption." This effect typically causes great pain and results in incapacitation, as when used against the [[Earth-712]] version of the hero [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]].<ref>''Avengers'' #141 (Nov. 1975). Marvel Comics.</ref> Being an artificial life-form/android of sorts, Vision has superhuman senses, superhuman stamina, reflexes, speed, agility, strength (even without being at high density), superhuman analytical capabilities, and the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. The Vision was trained in hand-to-hand combat by [[Captain America]], is an expert in the combat use of his superhuman powers, and is a highly skilled tactician and strategist. The Vision is an expert on his own construction and repair.

After the [[Age of Ultron]], Vision joins the [[Avengers A.I.]] team where his "evolve" protocols were activated and now his body is formed from millions of nanobots. He can now split himself into smaller parts and change shape.<ref name="Avengers A.I. #1"/>

== Other versions ==

=== Anti-Vision ===
During the story arc "The Gatherers" in the Avengers' books, the villain [[Proctor (comics)|Proctor]], who was from an alternate timeline, came to [[Earth-616]] with a version of Vision from yet another timeline. Proctor would wind up switching the bodies of both Visions and have his version infiltrate the Avengers as his mole.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1 #306</ref> The original Vision would eventually be freed and he would eventually take the Anti-Vision into custody when he came back to collect his original body.<ref name="Vision">''Vision'' #1–4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Mainframe ===
:''For the [[Marvel Comics 2|Earth-982 version]], see [[A-Next]]''.
The Earth-691 version of Mainframe is a future counterpart of Vision that is featured in the title ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''. Main Frame is the chief operating system of an entire planet, and the guardian of the [[shield]] of hero [[Captain America]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #5 (Oct. 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> He soon joins the Guardians of the Galaxy spinoff, the [[Galactic Guardians]].<ref>''Galactic Guardians'' #1–4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Earth X ===
A version of the modern Vision appeared in ''[[Earth X]]''. Vision and the Avengers were fighting the [[Absorbing Man]] who had absorbed the intelligence of [[Ultron]], giving him enhanced intelligence and better control over his powers. Vision watched as his teammates and wife the Scarlet Witch were slaughtered before his eyes. In response, Vision downloaded a computer virus into the Absorbing Man. When the Absorbing Man tried to purge the virus by shrinking and changing into stone, the Vision smashed him into pieces. In order to prevent the Absorbing Man from being reborn, the Vision had the parts of Creel distributed among various loners and reclusive super-heroes. When Tony Stark created a group of Iron Avengers, robots based on Stark technology and modeled after the deceased Avengers, Vision was tapped as the group's leader. He would lead the Iron Avengers and defend them from such threats as the parasitic [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]], [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Giants (Marvel Comics)#Giants of Jotunheim|Frost Giants]], and the [[Red Skull|Skull]]'s invading army.<ref>''Earth X'' #1–5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Exiles ===
